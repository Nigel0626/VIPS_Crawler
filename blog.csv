"Eat what, Eat where?","Wednesday, 22 September 2021",#ewew cooks Salted Egg Yolk Prawns,"A dish we like to order when we dine out at Chinese restaurants that has the approval of every member of my family is a dish cooked with salted egg yolk.  It can be salted egg yolk prawns, squid or even chicken though the first two are more popular among diners (and my family is no exception).
So, when I was given some fairly large, wild caught, (frozen) sea prawns, I decided to attempt to cook Salted Egg Yolk Prawns even though I've never cooked it before.  I was confident enough to take it on after I googled for the recipe and also watched a few videos on how it was done...and realised it was pretty easy to execute.",Ingredients:,"20 (fairly) large prawns, peeled & deveined, slit at the back2 salted egg yolks3 garlic cloves (or more), finely chopped4 sprigs of curry leaves, remove leaves from the stem4 green bird's eye chillies, sliced1 fresh red chilli, sliced1 egg, white & yolk separated2 tbsp cornflourA knob (about an inch) of butterOil (for deep or shallow frying of the prawns)1/4 tsp salt1/2 tsp sugar",Preparation:,"First thing is to prep the prawns (if you're using fresh sea prawns).  Mine came already deshelled and deveined (and that's how my family likes to eat them)...with no shells to contend with.  Some recipes will call for the prawns to be unpeeled while some would leave just the tails intact.  But all will probably agree to make a slit at the back of the prawn coz this will allow the prawn to absorb more salted egg flavour into its little crannies.
Coat the prawns in egg white (keep the yolk aside for later) and cornflour.  I also seasoned them with a pinch of salt and a dash of white pepper.  Steam two salted egg yolks for about 5 minutes and then mash them up with a fork (or chop them up finely).",Method:,"Deep-fry the coated prawns in hot oil (or shallow fry them like I did) and take them out as soon as they turn colour.  It's ok if the prawns are not cooked all the way through at this point.  If you want a thicker coating for your prawns, you'll have to use more cornflour to make a thicker batter.
Add a combination of butter and oil (2 - 3 tbsp) to saute your aromatics of chopped garlic (the more, the better), curry leaves (3 sprigs), red chillies and green bird's eye chillies.  The butter is for the fragrance and the oil is so that the butter won't burn (you can stick to just oil if you don't like the smell/taste of butter).
Saute the aromatics until fragrant.  Some will say as long as the curry leaves were fried in oil, their flavour and aroma will be released while others (like the elders) will tell you to tear the curry leaves to release its fragrance.  Not sure which is correct (perhaps someone can enlighten me...though I have to admit I can really smell the fragrance when I tear the curry leaves), so I tore some and left some whole coz whole leaves obviously look a lot more presentable in a dish.  At this point, your pan will be smelling really good from all the fragrant aromatics.
You can now add in your mashed salted egg yolks.  As you stir-fry the salted egg yolks bits, try to press them down with your spatula to break them up into an even finer paste.  Season to taste (I added a further 1/2 tsp sugar + 1/4 tsp salt).
You will need to saute the salted egg yolks slowly (in medium-low heat) until you see bubbles forming (that's the consistency you're looking for and it'll probably take a good 5 minutes).  At this point, you can drizzle in the egg yolk if you don't want the balance yolk to go to waste (but I forgot...oops!).
Once the salted egg yolk sauce is bubbling, you can then add in your (almost) cooked prawns.  Toss the prawns around to ensure they're well coated in the sauce (any prawns that weren't cooked through in the earlier frying process will now be thoroughly cooked).
My dish of Salted Egg Yolk Prawns is done.  Sprinkle over the top (totally optional) some crispy curry leaves (from the one sprig that I deep-fried earlier on and kept as garnish). ^o^
I have to say the dish turned out pretty successful (seeing it was my first time) as it got the seal of approval from my husband.  Perhaps it could do with a bit more salted egg yolk (maybe an additional yolk) as some would prefer more salted egg yolk taste (I've seen it done with 4 yolks for the same amount of prawns!) but I need to consider the health aspect.
The lightly crunchy prawns (even though they were of the frozen kind had a fairly good prawn taste in them unlike some) in savoury salted egg yolk sauce was a delicious pairing with the curry leaves giving it that added fragrance.  The curry leaves came courtesy of a neighbour who grows them abundantly in her garden and hers are really fragrant.
For a higher heat level, you could use red bird's eye chillies which are known to be a lot more fiery but I was afraid it'd be too spicy for me, so I used the green ones.  The red cili api would also help make the dish more colourful (I had to throw in some fresh red chillies instead) as it'll be able to stand out vibrantly against the green curry leaves and orange-coloured egg yolks.
Next, I might even try to make it with chicken (boneless, of course)...or even pork (that'll be a first, don't think I've ever had salted egg yolk pork before)....but probably won't attempt it with squid as getting squid crispy (and not chewy) is not easy to do.
Sometimes, we think a restaurant-quality dish is difficult to replicate at home but, at times, it turns out easier than we expected (even if it's not better).  The prawns done by restaurants have a much crispier effect (coz they're deep-fried in a lot of oil while mine was only shallow fried) but it's a good enough home version for me.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make actually...so, there'll be more salted egg yolk sauce dishes in the foreseeable future for sure since my family is a fan of anything salted egg yolk! ^_~","Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest

Wah this looks awesome, didn't know you have to separate the yolk out to steam first. Learned something new today, hopefully trying this out myself one of these days.
I also didn't know we had to steam the yolk first but if you don't, it's very difficult to mash/chop into small bits (I realised that when I tried to cut a raw yolk for a steamed minced pork dish!). Looking forward to seeing your salted egg yolk dish :)I also didn't know we had to steam the yolk first but if you don't, it's very difficult to mash/chop into small bits (I realised that when I tried to cut a raw yolk for a steamed minced pork dish!).

Yeah, i always thought salted egg yolk dishes are difficult to prepare at home, but after you cooked it once, you definitely can nail it easily!
Your salted egg egg prawns definitely looked scrumptious, but I also prefer it with more salted egg yolk. :P
Like you said, once we've cooked it, we'd realise how easy it is to do. Since you like more salted egg yolk taste, you can certainly add more to your version. ^_~Like you said, once we've cooked it, we'd realise how easy it is to do.

We share the same taste and sentiment. When our family dine out at Chinese restaurant, our favorite must order is salted egg yolk prawns (we only like prawns version). There is this regular restaurant which we always visit that serves very nice salted egg yolk prawns.

It is good that you know how to homemake this dish so that if anytime dine in is not allowed, you still have delicious salted egg yolk dish to eat. And yours looks tasty yums! 😋 😋
Thanks for your compliment. Since you only like the prawns version (which is easier to make than the squid version), you (or your mom) can try making this at home too (it's really not that hard to do).

When we dine out, we like to order the squid version since I don't cook that at home. ^_*Thanks for your compliment. Since you only like the prawns version (which is easier to make than the squid version), you (or your mom) can try making this at home too (it's really not that hard to do).

Wow! I could polish off the entire plate of your Salted Egg Yolk Prawns!! hee..hee.. I must go and look for those sea shrimps. I simply have to try your recipe and the best part is I have plenty of curry leaves in my garden!
For you, I think you'll need to 'tambah' 1 or 2 more salted egg yolks for a more robust flavour + I'm sure you'll be using the fiery red cili api instead...hee..hee. Polish the entire plate by yourself? Oh no, that'll be too rich for me...this is just nice for 3 persons (with two other dishes) with rice.For you, I think you'll need to 'tambah' 1 or 2 more salted egg yolks for a more robust flavour + I'm sure you'll be using the fiery red cili api instead...hee..hee.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Wednesday, 15 September 2021",Yayoi via Delivery,"I first noticed Yayoi when I visited Lot 10's 4th floor.  They're part of J's Gate Dining concept which houses a number of speciality restaurants on one floor with each specialising in a specific Japanese cuisine like tendon, udon, soba, teppan rice, shabu-shabu & sukiyaki, tonkatsu, yakitori, okonomiyaki, teppanyaki & yakisoba, tonkotsu ramen, chicken ramen, matcha desserts, crepes and even Italian gelato and coffee.
I've dined in three of them before namely Bonta Bonta, Kaisen Don Kinme and Osaka Kitchen...but sadly only Osaka Kitchen remains till this day as part of J's Gate Dining.  I've walked past Yayoi a couple of times but have not tried until now, so what better time to try Yayoi than via delivery courtesy of a dinner treat recently! ^_~
Yayoi is a Japanese Teishoku restaurant specialising in set meals offering various bentos, donburi and a la carte side dishes with complimentary miso soup.  Perhaps the previous Bonta Bonta (specialising in unagi don) and Kaisen Don Kinme (specialising in seafood don) had been absorbed into Yayoi since they offer unagi and seafood rice bowls too on their menu.
This was the Beef Nasumiso & Saba Shio Bento @ RM30.90 served with rice, sides and miso soup.
One of the mains of this bento was the beef nasu miso which consists of miso glazed eggplant with stir-fried beef slices, red bell peppers and shimeji mushrooms.  This was a very flavourful main as they were rather heavy-handed with the miso, so it was a tad on the salty side for me (so you'll need more rice) but tasty nonetheless especially the beef slices, thinly sliced and tender (wished there were more of it though).
Saba shioyaki (or salt grilled mackerel) made up the other main of this bento.  Unfortunately, this came off like the saba was steamed instead of grilled.  It was missing the much sought-after charred marks and grilled taste.
It did come with condiments of grated daikon and a wedge of lemon but it badly needed some shoyu since the saba wasn't salty.  Also, for some reason, the grated daikon came off a bit bitter.
The sides were tamagoyaki (Japanese rolled omelette) and edamame.  The tamagoyaki, however, tasted like an underseasoned omelette though the texture was alright.  It lacked the usual sweet and savoury flavours, so it was a bit flat.
The second bento was the Wafu Teppan Combo (Beef & Kaarage) Bento @ RM32.90 served with rice, sides and miso soup.  Visually, it was a colourful bento.
The main for this bento was stir-fried beef and fried chicken kaarage with potato wedges, red bell peppers, snow peas, sweet corn and pickled cucumber.
The thinly sliced beef was tender but would have loved to see some charring (after all this was supposedly teppanyaki-style cooking).  As for the fried chicken kaarage and potato wedges....well, you simply can't foul up something that simple to execute.
This bento came with two sides from the earlier bento..... tamagoyaki and edamame with the addition of sweet corn and pickled cucumber.
Both bentos were served with complimentary miso soup that contained pieces of kombu (dried kelp) and omelette shreds.  Again, I found the soup to be on the salty side due to either the dashi broth or the use of a bit too much miso paste.
There was an extra a la carte side order of Gyoza @ RM15.90 featuring 6 pcs of juicy, plump-filled gyoza with an accompanying dipping sauce.  This turned out to be my favourite bite of the night.",My Personal Opinion,"Overall, Yayoi's set meals are reasonably priced with a good variety and fair portions.  I'd say the meals were average tasting at best from the two set meals I tried.  The biggest issue I had was in the seasoning of the food as some of the components were either underseasoned (like the tamagoyaki & saba) and some were overseasoned (like the nasu miso & miso soup).  Perhaps the chef had an off day. >_<
You can order directly from yayoi.alacarte.my for delivery from any of their branches in Lot 10, The Gardens, Waterfront Desa Park City and IOI City Mall if you're interested to give it a try.",Yayoi Malaysia,Lot P1-19 Level 4Lot 10 Shopping CentreJalan Sultan Ismail50250 Kuala LumpurTel: 03-2110 4448,"Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest

after reading the not-so-good review like certain dishes being over-seasoned or under-seasoned, i think i shall give this place a second thought coz taste consistency is crucial especially when the customer is paying that much for a bento meal. Tamagoyaki should not taste flat, even the economical AEON pre-packed tamago sushi have tinge of sweetness in it.
Actually, the bento prices are considered reasonable (seeing that it came from Lot 10) but wished the cooking and taste of it could be better though.Actually, the bento prices are considered reasonable (seeing that it came from Lot 10) but wished the cooking and taste of it could be better though.
I love to eat tamagoyaki a lot and tamago sushi is one of my favorites but regret to hear that it is flat and does not taste sweet.
I, too, like to eat tamagoyaki with its light sweetness (though there are also savoury ones that I enjoy). ^_~I, too, like to eat tamagoyaki with its light sweetness (though there are also savoury ones that I enjoy). ^_~
Variety of different items in one dish is certainly something you can't really do at home.
You're right about that...unless you're making many portions for more family members.You're right about that...unless you're making many portions for more family members.
I miss Japanese bento meals. I have tried food that are just all right, average tasting, not bad but not that good. But if the price is reasonable, I guess we can't really complain. If there is one thing that I dislike it is tamagoyaki, in spite of my love for eggs.
Oh, you don't like tamagoyaki...even with some sweetness in the rolled egg? Hmmm, I wonder why. I take it then that omelette is your least favourite way of having eggs? ;)Oh, you don't like tamagoyaki...even with some sweetness in the rolled egg? Hmmm, I wonder why.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Tuesday, 7 September 2021",Sally's Kitchen Homecooked Food Delivery (for August),"Continuing with Sally's Kitchen Homecooked Food Delivery for this month, I'm continuously amazed that after six months, they still churn out new and different dishes for their customers so that we won't get bored with their food.
The first week of August started with their Dry Pork Curry Rice Set @ RM12 with sides of salted egg (the yolk was oily and glistening, I likey) and stir-fried cabbage with carrot shreds and glass noodles.  I thought I hadn't had their pork curry before but, on checking back, I realised I had...and this turned out to be a repeated dish from May.
So, it looks like I've eaten their chicken curry, fish curry, vegetable curry and pork curry too....and they're all fantastic.  The pork was tender and the curry thick and delicious with the welcoming sight of more potatoes. You won't regret ordering any of their curries...it's certainly their forte!  The pork curry was even better this time round with a much thicker curry paste! ;)
The other option for the week was their Chicken Stew for the Soul @ RM11 with sides of stir-fried french beans & fishcake slices.  The presence of lots of crispy, fragrant bits of dried prawns elevated the taste of this vegetable stir-fry.
At first, I thought this would be a typical Chinese stew that's done with oyster and dark sauce but it turned out to be a take on a western-type stew (I should have guessed since they named it chicken stew for the soul...lol).  This stew had super tender fall-off-the-bone chicken leg/thigh pieces cooked with carrots, potatoes, shimeji mushrooms and some green herbs (I'm guessing bay leaf, parsley and maybe some oregano).  The chicken stew was thick and tasty, albeit a little on the oily side (I think it was cooked with some butter), but I thoroughly enjoyed it nevertheless since it was different from a Chinese-type stew.
The third dish for the week featured Mushroom Aglio Olio with Breaded Pork Chop @ RM12.  The breaded pork chop was well seasoned (I could taste the seasoning in the crispy breading itself).

It was a generous slab of thickly cut pork chop and because of that, it could have been a bit more tender if it was pounded thinner, I suppose...but it was still tasty nonetheless with that light drizzle of mayonnaise.
The aglio olio, fried with shimeji mushrooms, lots of garlic and finely minced fresh red chillies (not chilli flakes from a bottle), was a bit too oily unfortunately (but it was my box only, perhaps my serving was from the bottom of the pile!).  I quite enjoyed the heat level in the spaghetti (I think they used either bird's eye chillies or their red chillies were the hot type) though some might feel it's too spicy (for a pasta dish).
Week 2 which featured Kimchi Fried Rice with Chicken Bulgogi, Har Cheong (Shrimp Paste) Sliced Pork with Fried Egg & Kangkung and a repeat of Fried Mee Siam & Chicken Curry Kapitan (from April).  Since I'm not a fan of kimchi and can't say I'm particularly fond of shrimp paste either + I just had chicken curry two weeks prior, I took a break from ordering from Sally's Kitchen.
The following week saw my most favourite dish, the Taiwanese Braised Pork Rice (Lou Ro Fan) @ RM12, making a comeback again.  Of course I had to order....what do you think?  Same good taste as always! ;)
Next up was their Nasi Lemak Ayam Masak Merah @ RM12 served with hard-boiled egg, fried ikan bilis & nuts, cucumber and sambal.  I've seen this dish before (in the earlier days when I started ordering from Sally's Kitchen) but have not tried it before.
I've not eaten that many ayam masak merah to know the true flavours of it but I felt that this wasn't quite it.  First of all, it didn't quite have the looks of an ayam masak merah as I was expecting it to be more reddish in colour (I think it's from the use of tomato sauce....correct me if I'm wrong).
This one just looked (and tasted) like some sambal/chilli paste type of spicy chicken (almost like a Chinese-style sambal chicken with lots of onions)....but not withstanding that, it was still a pretty tasty chicken.
The week ended with their Friday Special of Char Mee Suah @ RM12 with sides of Penang Lo Bak & fresh sambal belacan (which is no longer too spicy for me as I can sapu all).  The fried Penang Lo Bak was very similar to their earlier Nyonya Lobak Rice Set except this time the lobak was much bigger and thicker in size.
The fried mee suah (wheat vermicelli) was very nicely done....which isn't easy to do seeing how soft the texture of mee suah can be (it's usually done soup-style).  It was tastefully fried with fishcake slices, crunchy beansprouts and fragrant chives.  The noodles were topped with fresh medium-sized prawns too (three of them to be exact).  This char mee suah was yet another successful noodle dish.
The final week of August offered two rice sets I've had before.....Marmite Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork (with sides of veggies and an egg dish).  They tasted all right but not something I'm dying to eat again.  But their third menu item of Tom Yam Spaghetti @ RM13 totally attracted me with its picture of the large prawns.
Even though I was a little weary of the spaghetti, due to my earlier experience with the rather oily Aglio Olio, I still went ahead to order it as the promo pic of the dish with large prawns sitting on top the spaghetti was just too tempting to resist.
This time, my fears of oily spaghetti was unfounded as the spaghetti was nicely done.  The spaghetti was stir-fried with shimeji mushrooms and just the right amount of tom yam paste for a slightly spicy-sour aftertaste. The large-sized prawns, thankfully were fresh prawns (and not frozen ones...and there were four) with that all-important prawn taste.  The finishing touches of shredded coriander leaves and a few fine slivers of kaffir lime added a fresh and fragrant dimension to the pasta.  So good! ^o^

Not only is Sally's Kitchen good at cooking Nyonya-type dishes and curries, they seem to be equally adapt at cooking noodles from mee siam, fried meehoon and zha jiang mian to pasta like this month's mushroom aglio olio and tom yam spaghetti.  I am liking their noodle dishes just as much and can't wait to try eat more! ^_~","Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: Food Delivery, Food: Chinese",14 comments:,"I am very impressed with Sally's Kitchen after hearing so much from you. They should be named Sally's Thoughtful Kitchen for planning and cooking so well to make the residents happy. You guys would never get bored.
I really love to eat Nyonya-style dishes, Mee Siam and Zha Jiang Mian. Good ones are not easy to find nowadays.

Their western styled Chicken Stew for the Soul made me drool when you said it was thick and tasty with super tender fall-off-the-bone chicken parts with carrots and potatoes. Good heavens. I love that!
Yes, the chicken stew was certainly comforting and heart warming for the soul...kekeke! ;) I'm sure your lovely wife can make that for you.

I love that Sally's Kitchen continue to brainstorm and cook new dishes for us to savour so that we won't get bored with the food. Although they're located in my neighbourhood, I understand they do deliver to other areas (minimum 2 orders with a delivery fee (probably RM7 - RM8 to your place). If you don't mind paying delivery charges (for simple homecooked dishes), you can enjoy Sally's cooking too. ^_*
I hope my neighbourhood can have such catering restaurants so that I can have a rest sometimes. Now not only weekdays dinner, I need to plan my bento lunch as well as lunch for Sam who stay at home too, because I'm skeptical to tapao food from outside also. But once a while I'll force to tapao for her too due to lack of ideas what to cook >_<
We've been tapao-ing mostly since the pandemic started in March last year with no untoward incidents (even from places that were closed at one time or another). Just remember to follow your own strict SOPs. I'd rather tapao coz 1) less work than cooking, 2) don't know what to cook sometimes, 3) outside food tastes better than my cooking...lol & 4) the eateries need our support to survive. As I mentioned (in my reply to TM), though Sally's Kitchen is not from your neighbourhood, they cover delivery to other areas with a delivery charge (foc if you order 6 portions). You can consider their homely food so that you take a rest from cooking sometimes. ^_~
From Cheras to Kepong, the delivery feew would be quite ""kaw"" I believe. :P
I,m a cheapskate that not willing to pay delivery fee, LOL
Her delivery fees I feel are very reasonable too...RM6 - RM10 (she only charged RM10 all the way to Shah Alam). But if you're not willing to pay delivery fees, then I can't help you there...lol! ;) P/S: So I take it that you cook most of the time (like one of my neighbours) since you're skeptical to go out to tapao food and don't wish to pay delivery. I used to do cooking the most (when the pandemic started) but now I do it the least (tired of cooking and tired of my own cooking)...hehe!
curry pork pls! I haven't had pork for 3 weeks already!
No pork delivery to your area? Hah...hah..go get some curry pork pronto! :D
My eyes wide opened with the level of variety Sally's kitchen offers, i like almost all the dishes you featured here from the chicken stew for the soul to the breaded pork chop and char mee suah with lo bak some more. How i wish i have such a neighbourhood caterer which cooks and provides such homely food.
Yeah, I'm indeed very lucky to have found Sally (9 months late...but better late than never!). Keep your fingers crossed that one opens up in your neighbourhood one day. :)
the foods are so delicious looking....I hope they have an outlet nearby my house~~~
Unfortunately, this is a home kitchen operating from their house, so there won't be any other outlet (unless their business thrives to the point that they need to expand to a central kitchen/shop). ^_~
Am I envious or what? hah..hah..hah... All the dishes for August look very good and I would be happy to order. From your photos, I would say that the dish that attracted me the most is the Tom Yam Spaghetti (ooo...corriander!)followed by the Dry Pork Curry and Chicken Stew. The Ayam Masak Merah was clearly not what it is supposed to be but since it still tasted very good, no disappointments there. You are right that Ayam Masak Merah has tomato sauce in it (as well as chili sauce too) and it is one of my favorite Malays dishes. I like fried mee suah but have not come across it for a long time. Long ago there was a restaurant called Aunty Nat near my office and they dished out a pretty good fried mee suah.

Well, you and your neighbors will keep Sally in business and hopefully Sally's Kitchen is a permanent feature to supply you lucky people with very tasty and affordable food.
Hah...hah..I'd be envious too if you had one such tasty and affordable food delivery servicing your area. Yeah, we can count ourselves lucky indeed but I don't think my neighbourhood can keep them in business as we only make up a small part of their clientele, I believe. I should think they do lots of other deliveries out of our neighbourhood (she once told me they even delivered until Shah Alam!). ^_*

"Eat what, Eat where?","Wednesday, 1 September 2021",#ewew cooks Stir-Fried Chinese Leeks with Lap Cheong,"The first time I cooked leeks was during Chinese New Year (CNY) earlier this year.  It so happened I was at my neighbourhood supermarket when I noticed the leeks (and if I remember correctly, I think they were from China).
Even though I've never cooked leeks before (I'm the only in my family who likes them, so I usually get them from the chap fan stalls when it's available), I decided to get some since leeks is an auspicious ingredient for CNY.  Cooking this for our reunion dinner with (extended) family, I didn't know I would like it so much.  
So, the other day, when I spotted leeks selling at my neighbourhood wet market, I immediately got myself some as I wanted to cook and eat my Stir-Fried Chinese Leeks with Lap Cheong again.  Even though the leeks I got this time were also from China, they weren't as thick as the ones I bought previously.  The previous ones were much larger and tend to have a longer length of the white parts but they were also more expensive.
The leeks look like a plumped up version of spring onions.  This dish is one of the simplest dishes you can cook.  All you need is just two ingredients.....leeks and lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and a bit of garlic, of course.  It can't get any easier than that! ;)
Cut your leeks diagonally (it's much prettier and more presentable that way)...just the white parts (which also means the lighter green parts).  Now the debate is on whether the (darker) green parts of the leek are edible (more like good enough to eat).  Most said yes, it can be eaten (I'll let you know what I think of that later).
I start by pan-frying the lap cheong slices in some oil first (before adding the chopped garlic)...and that's because I like them slightly caramelised (but that's just me).  The sugar (or sweetness) in the lap cheong helps with the caramelisation and makes it that much more fragrant.
But if you don't like those darkened bits (as I know many people freak out at the sight of them), then put both the lap cheong and garlic in to stir-fry at the same time.
As soon as the garlic browns, add in the sliced leeks....the white parts only! ;)  The leeks should be cooked until the texture still has a light crunch.  That's how I like to eat them.
I don't like to cook it till too soft...so I don't add any water (nor cover my pan) to help it soften.  The frying process itself would soften it naturally.  It should only take a minute or two and I simply seasoned it with a bit of salt.  That's it.....is that too easy or what?  Lol.
I've been hooked on eating this simple dish of Stir-Fried Chinese Leeks with Lap Cheong ever since I first cooked it for CNY.  And the beauty of this stir-fry is that nothing is set in stone!  You don't have to have an exact amount of each ingredient in a stir-fry, you can vary them according to what you like to have more.  In this case, you can use more lap cheong if you want more meat in your dish (here I used one lap cheong to 3 stalks of leeks).
The sweetish-salty flavours of the lap cheong goes really well with the oniony flavour and crunchy texture of the leeks.  Just ensure you get some good quality lap cheong and this one was fragrant with that hint of wine...really good.  Now all you need is rice!  This is typical of those easy to make one-dish meals that I like (and this was the perfect portion for me with a small bowl of rice). ^o^
How do you know if you'll like leeks?  Well, if you're someone who enjoys eating spring onions, garlic chives or even onions, then you'll most probably enjoy leeks too as they all share an almost similar taste profile.  I love them...but I've to say the China leeks I got during CNY were just a tad sweeter and tastier though.  I'm not sure if it was because it's a different variety or because it was the timing when it was grown (nearer to CNY)! ;)
Coming back to the question of whether the green parts can be eaten....well, the answer is yes...but it wouldn't be very tasty (when I included them once)...at least not to me.  The darker green parts I found to be quite stringy and chewy.
The other negative would be that there's quite a bit of dirt and sand trapped in between the green parts, so you have to be extra careful to remove the layers of the leek to wash them thoroughly.  I wouldn't go through all that trouble seeing that it wasn't that nice to eat in the end.
The most common pairing I've eaten leeks with is with siu yuk (I usually find it at chap fan stalls where it's cooked till soft).  You can cook it with waxed meat too.  Or cook it with canned spicy pork cubes it seems (perhaps I can try that next). 
I think I'll stick to eating the best parts only....which are the more delicate white parts! ^.^  For those of you who love leeks and are looking for a simple stir-fry or one-dish meal, this is a good contender.  If you end up liking it as much as I do, you can perhaps cook this for CNY since the dish bears auspicious ingredients of leeks and lap cheong which signifies wealth and long life!  You bet I'll be getting more of the plumper leeks if I see it sold during CNY again. ^_~","Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest

Your comment:
I just cut many pairs of leeks last week when our gang was cooking food for the charity homes. My wife asked me to cut them for her 3 woks full of chicken wings and drummets in dark soya sauce. I thought leeks was meant to give additional flavour like spring onions. I am surprised you love it as a dish by itself. Of course, lap cheong is my favourite with burnt edges! Yums!

Next time, I will scoop this leeks dish from Chap Fan stalls to try. Probably scoop some fried lap cheong from separate trays too. I should love them since I am a celery and spring onions fan.

My reply:
Yes, we do use leeks (like spring onions) to add more flavour to our dishes but they're also good as a veggie dish on their own. Phiak...to liking burnt edges in lap cheong! ;)

This dish is not so commonly found at chap fan stalls probably because of the cost factor coz when stir-fried, they wilt down to not much. >_<
I happen to love leeks and I love them fried with prawns. Your version with lap cheong is even better especially with the caramelization of the lap cheong - extra flavor! I am betting that if fried with prawns and lap cheong it will be da bomb! hah..hah... I have tried the green parts in soup and since it is tasteless, I don't use that part anymore. By the way, thanks for the link to my old post hee...hee...
Oh, I seldom use leeks in soups. I guess they work in the same way as spring onions as I'd put the white parts only in soups & stews to get better flavours. Wow, frying leeks with both lap cheong and prawns...certainly can but that would mean more protein than vegetables...hah..hah. For prawns, I prefer them stir-fried with asparagus.
Regret to say even though I do like to eat onions, I am still not accustomed to the taste of leeks. I find them cho cho one (if you understand hokkien). That's why I ate up all the spicy pork cubes but not the leeks when my mom cooked them.

I will eat up all your caramelized lap cheongs in your leeks dish lol. Thanks for the link to my blog post. :)
Ah, I see you left all the leeks to your mom and ate up all the spicy pork cubes instead. It's good that family members like to eat different things, then each can finish up the parts the other person doesn't like...lol! Like when we have chicken at a family dinner, there'll be someone who finishes up the breast parts.
Leek is even better than green onion!
I like leek to be cooked with Lap Cheong and I also substituted Lap Cheong with waxed meat (La Rou) if I have any in my pantry.
Ya, I like the sweetish flavours the lap cheong impart into the leeks.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Thursday, 26 August 2021",Fatt Kee Roast Duck @ Sri Petaling,"We came here wanting to eat at Spade's Burger but was told that their buns had run out and that the replenishment stock was due to arrive later that evening (yeah, don't ask...how could a burger place run out of buns, right?).  We didn't want to wait, so we left (we've since managed to taste Spade's burgers through delivery).
After leaving Spade's (with no back-up plan in mind), we started walking around for another place to dine and finally ended up at Fatt Kee Roast Duck @ Sri Petaling.  As you walk in, you'll be greeted by some kind of a window display at the front showing their variety of roasted meats.  Unfortunately, the window display was bare....with just one miserable chicken and one duck still hanging even though it was only dinner time (business must be slow since only two tables were occupied).  Perhaps the display would have been brimming and more enticing to look at earlier in the day, I suppose.
Well, if you're one who likes to have a variety, then the best way to savour everything would be to order the All-In-Fatt @ RM28, a special four-in-one combo featuring roast duck, roast chicken, siu yuk and char siew...and that's precisely what we got! ;)
This dine-in was quite some time ago, so pardon me if I can't quite remember what they tasted like exactly though I do remember that nothing quite caught my attention other than the roast duck.  The siu yuk wasn't the best of cuts, a bit too fatty and the skin was a little hard.  The char siew was ok I suppose, just that the sauce wasn't among my favourites while the roast chicken, we got all breast meat...what do you think?  I hate it when some shops take advantage of a situation (where we forgot to request for the cut we want or can't coz it's a combo platter) by getting rid of as much breast meat as possible (more like dumping it on unsuspecting customers if you ask me).  The roast duck was the only thing I do remember.  Perhaps my experience might have been different if I had eaten there earlier in the day when the meats were at their best (perhaps these had been hung at the shop front for too long?).  And yes, I saw the worker removing the last hanging duck and taking it into the kitchen to cut up for us.
As much as it's a good idea to go for a combo platter in order to be able to taste test all their meats in one sitting, it may also not be such a good idea coz each meat has a specific sauce and they tend to mingle with one another on the plate thereby not allowing one to taste each component (with their respective sauces) separately.
You can have the roasted meats with yellow (chicken) rice @ RM1 a bowl.....
.......or with plain wantan mee @ RM3.80 a plate.  It was quite nice as the wantan mee (the thinner type) was tossed in a sauce with fragrant pork lard and I did like the inclusion of the little cubes of crispy chee yau char (pork lard bits).
You can partake all that with their freshly blended chilli dip and ginger sauce.  I can't really remember if I liked their dips but I always welcome any blended ginger with chicken rice/roasted meats as I like how they cut through all that fattiness and oiliness.
But the one thing I do remember very well was how much I liked their Tofu with Dried Shrimps @ RM8.80. The fragrant and super crispy dried shrimps, together with freshly made fried shallots and flavourful sauce, made the bland silken tofu all that more delicious to eat. ^o^
This was yet another chicken and duck rice shop that doesn't come with complimentary soup (is this becoming a trend?).  I seem to have encountered quite a few of them lately as in Loke Yun Chicken Rice, Soon Fatt Beijing Roast Duck, Chen Chen Roast Goose & Duck and now Fatt Kee Roast Duck.  At least this one was because they offer double-boiled/steamed soups on their menu.  So, obviously, they won't offer you free soup lah.....lol! >_<",My Personal Opinion,"I've passed their branch in Pudu quite a few times but have never ventured in to try.  Who knew I'd end up eating it at their outlet in Sri Petaling (by chance) instead.  I'll reserve my judgement on Fatt Kee until I've had a chance to try the roasted meats at their original Pudu (HQ) branch.
Anyway, there's this pulling factor that make me want to return to eat their utterly sumptuous dish of tofu with dried shrimps.  Who would have thought that a simple tofu dish would be the one that entices me to return to a shop specialising in roasted meats. ^_~",Fatt Kee Roast Duck & Chicken Rice Shop,No 47-G Jalan Radin BagusBandar Baru Sri Petaling57000 Kuala LumpurTel: 011-1622 3320,"Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: Food: Chinese, Location: Sri Petaling, Roasted Meats",14 comments:,"Haha, that's really out of my expectation indeed because tofu dish was the best dish that you had in a roasted meat restaurant, somemore the tofu dish is the simplest one that many of us can replicate it at home easily!

I was equally surprised myself too...hee..hee! Although I do make this tofu dish quite frequently at home, I can't get the dried prawns that crispy nor the sauce tasting quite like theirs though. ^_*
First thing first. That delicious tofu would have done well to have some sprinkling of spring onions or coriander leaves hah..hah... They were quite generous with the topping of dried shrimps and freshly made fried shallots (thankfully not those commercial pre-fried ones).

I can't believe that Spade Burger outlet ran out of buns hah..hah.. either the person in charge of stock control forgot to re-order or the problem was at the supplier's side.

When it comes to roasted meat, I would also be tempted to order a combo. Yup, I too have been a victim of chicken breast dumping LOL! Somehow I always forget to specify the chicken part I prefer.

I guess you would visit the Pudu branch once you are able to in order to really assess the roast duck and other roasted meats. Wonder if the tofu over at Pudu is just as good hee..hee..
Yes, I agree with you 100% on the sprinkling of something green, then the dish would have photographed better. I hate those poor quality commercially pre-fried ones but it's certainly a lot less work to use them. Incidentally, someone gifted me a container of pre-fried shallots and they were pretty good.

Since you did mention once that you find Spade's buns not that fresh, maybe they were trying to eradicate that and have fresh buns delivered to them daily but ran into supplier/transport problems (they can be forgiven since it was during pandemic times).

Based on the comments here, looks like chicken breast 'dumping' is a norm and many of us end up at the receiving end. I can understand them wanting to get 'rid' of breast meat (since only a minority would ask for that cut) but they should give a bit of breast meat together with some other choice cuts and not all breast meat lah! >_<

I guess I'll know when I do dine-in at the Pudu branch but that will be some time in the very distant future..lol. Many of my neighbourhood shops are still afraid to open for dine-in (even after they've been allowed to for a week now)...guess everyone is adopting a wait-and-see approach.
I have a soft spot for tofu too. I remember crystal jade in sg serves something similar to this all in one combo set too. They call it the bbq combination set where there is a choice of 4 meats but we can only choose 3. That time we choose roast duck, roast chicken and siew yuk as we were not so keen on the char siew. The roast duck was tender and juicy, the roast chicken fresh and the roast meat crispy and charred.

Same as you, I hate it when they serve breast meat for the chicken so I always remind myself to tell them no breast meat, please give us thigh or drumsticks.
For us here, almost every shop will offer a combo of whatever roasted meat we want. I see you don't like breast meat either.
I like their interior with the polished wooden chairs and tables. So did you eat the combo set with rice or wanton noodles. The tofu with dried shrimps and shallots looks tasty but I would eat it without eating the dried shrimps.
I ate the combo with a bit of both (there was another bowl of rice). For me, the fragrant dried shrimps is what makes the tofu less bland but I can understand why some people don't like dried shrimps coz they can taste quite pungent like shrimp paste and belacan.
I seem to be seeing lots of pictures of roast duck recently and here you go too. It has given me a craving.
Roast duck (or any roasted meat) travels really well, that's probably why they're very popular with delivery and takeaways.
I too want to masuk restaurant makan chasiu siu yoke roast duck all!
Now can masuk to eat already mah! :D
never cross my mind to try out the roasted meat in this shop despite staying quite nearby there. Only the tofu is outstanding among the other roasted meat...LOL! Spade burger running out of bun?!! business must be good for them!
Either business is very good...or they fouled up on their stock control of the buns...lol! Since you stay nearby, perhaps the tofu might tempt you to go there? ;)

"Eat what, Eat where?","Wednesday, 18 August 2021",Kafei Dian @ Pandan Indah,"I first got to know about this kafei dian (which literally means kopitiam) when they opened in Chinatown (Petaling Street) in 2019 with their old-school coffee shop vibe of cement floors, wooden chairs, marbled and tiled table tops with lots of greenery.
And sometime last year, they opened a branch in my neighbourhood, Kafe Dian @ Pandan Indah.  My sister-in-law informed me of them coz she happened to pass by and was invited in to try some of their food, yam cake in particular.
One of their most popular dishes is their Nasi Lemak Ayam Rendang @ RM11.90 served with half a hard-boiled egg, crispy ikan bilis & groundnuts, sambal and a refreshing acar (pickled vegetables of carrot, onions, pineapple, cucumber & chillies).
I'd consider the ayam rendang good (but a bit spicy lah) for a Chinese version.  The sambal was also spicy seeing that it's from a Chinese eatery.  The green-coloured, pandan-infused rice didn't have much of a santan aroma and the consistency was a little sticky and starchy.  I'm guessing that there must be some glutinous rice in the mix.  If you're looking for santan-flavoured rice, you won't get it here.
Next, I gave their Nasi Lemak with Fried Ikan Kembong @ RM11.90 a try.  It was served with the same condiments as the earlier nasi lemak ayam rendang.
Their ikan kembong (fried Indian mackerel) was super, super crispy....too crispy if you ask me until it was over-fried and the slit on the fish made the flesh dry out even more.  My preference would be for the fish to be crisp and fragrant around the edges while the flesh remains slightly moist.
And again, I was tempted by yet another fish dish, their Fried Tenggiri Fish + Rice @ RM16.90.  Why not?....since I love fried fish (and I enjoyed this fish more than the fried ikan kembong.
The tenggiri (Spanish mackerel or kau yue) was fresh and nicely fried with some ginger shreds.  I think they can afford to give a little bit more veggie, don't you think?  They call the veggies Penang Mengkuang Char (similar to stir-fried yam bean with dried squid, Chinese mushrooms and shredded carrot).
What I found a bit weird was that it came served with an assam broth (I'm guessing it's the same one you get with assam laksa) as a sauce since, overall, it didn't have any sauce.  This was probably an afterthought to throw in this assam broth since the dish may be difficult to consume (for some, me included) when it's predominantly dry.
The Seafood Fried Rice @ RM13.50 came with prawns, fried egg, fish cake slices and carrot bits.  You can detect a light hint of wok hei but otherwise the rice was just bland.  The prawns texture was the overly crunchy type which didn't have any flavour in them (aka frozen farmed/lower quality prawns).  Let's just say you can get tastier and cheaper fried rice from any siew chow stall and they will be heads and shoulders above this one.
Other than the nice egg layer on top, the Penang Fried Kway Teow @ RM10.50 wasn't very successful either. The noodles didn't look nor taste like they were well fried, so don't expect any charred flavour or wok hei. Again, the dish was accompanied by crunchy, frozen prawns that were devoid of flavour.
I saw quite a few people order the (Dried) Shrimp Curry Chee Cheong Fun @ RM5, so I thought I'd give it a go.  Unfortunately, the curry was not the thick kind.  Don't underestimate the little bit of chilli sauce provided as it packs quite a punch to the overall taste.  It was a just ok curry chee cheong fun but certainly not quite in the league of Yap Hup Kee's chee cheong fun by a country mile.
The Yam/Taro Cake @ RM4.30 (for 2 pcs) had a balance texture of smooth with bits of yam pieces within it.  I was glad to see it come with a good sprinkling of minced dried prawns, fried shallots, fresh peanuts, chopped spring onions and tiny bits of fresh red chillies.  This (incidentally) is not on their menu...you have to get them from the counter already pre-packed.
Though it wasn't the best yam cake I've had, it was still a very decent yam cake by many standards and probably the best you can find in my neighbourhood even though there weren't much fragrance in the dried prawns and the fried shallots were no longer crispy.
Of course, when one comes to a kopitiam like this, an order of Half-Boiled (Kampong) Eggs @ RM3 is a must.....but their eggs were served barely lukewarm.
That tells me it's probably done sous-vide style sitting in a temperature-controlled bath which means no human error of overcooked eggs but also not piping hot fresh out of boiling water.  I like mine so hot it would burn my fingers when I hold on to the egg to try and crack it...lol! :D  If you're one who likes their half-boiled eggs piping hot, this one isn't quite for you. >.<
This was their Toasted Bun with Butter & Kaya @ RM3.  Their inhouse-made kaya was slightly sweet for my taste buds but should be just right for the masses.  The kaya didn't give me that homemade vibe but a decent kaya by commercial standards nevertheless, more sweet than fragrant.
A breakfast of a freshly toasted bun (or bread) lathered with copious amounts of kaya complete with cubes (or slices) of cold butter and enjoyed with a hot cup of coffee on-site (not necessarily this one) is what I miss most with no dine-in. :'(
I can't say I'm totally on board with the taste of their Iced Black Coffee @ RM3.50 nor their Hot Cham (combination of coffee + milk tea) @ RM2.90 though.",My Personal Opinion,"Nothing I've tried so far is inedible or bad tasting....but neither could I say that something I had was particularly good either.  The food is generally decent or average at best, so don't have too high an expectation when you dine here.  It's a place where the ambience and comfort is a notch above what you'd get in a typical old-school coffee shop.  Although prices seem reasonable for the type of food charged, some will find the portions a little small (a single dish may not be enough).
I suppose you could say that they're a jack of all trades but master of none as I noticed that they have quite a variety on their menu but you can't put your finger on what they're especially good at since no one dish stood out enough (of all the dishes I've tried thus far) for me to say....yes, this one is better than the other (similar) one I had before.
Still, it has given me and my family an extra option on where to dine for some of our meals.  So, perhaps I'll just say what I won't mind having again here...and that would be the yam cake, toasted bun with butter & kaya, fried tenggiri and ayam rendang.",Kafei Dian,No 1 & 3 Jalan Pandan Indah 4/4Pandan Indah55100 Kuala Lumpur,"Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest

Just as I guess so from your reviews, what you like most would be the yam cake, true enough you said so in the end. Can see overall the dishes served in this coffeeshop are rather disappointing and nothing to shout about but good that you tried, at least now you know what you like and what you don't like.

I love to eat my yam cake with chili sauce and crispy fried shallots.

You just reminded me that I did not have half boiled eggs for quite some time.

Thanks for sharing and thanks for the review.
Ah, so you guessed correct...that must have been due to the yam cake looking more delicious than the rest in the photos...lol.

You can easily make half boiled eggs at home to the exact doneness you like...but having it with toasted bun with butter & kaya, that needs dine-in (which we're now allowed starting today) but I see most shops have not opened for dine-in yet. ^_~Ah, so you guessed correct...that must have been due to the yam cake looking more delicious than the rest in the photos...lol.

It seems like the food is passable with nothing outstanding. But with the variety they offer I reckon most people on average can accept it as long as the price is affordable.
I hear their Chinatown branch is quite well received. Perhaps the food at this branch is not on par...but I wouldn't know since I've not dined at their Chinatown branch.I hear their Chinatown branch is quite well received.

Good sharing. I have similar thoughts with you esp about half boiled eggs that must be piping hot. I would swallow them at one go like how the Japanese folks eat them without stirring it. Most cafes serve them almost cooled & bluek. Another plus is enjoying good and delicious Yam Cakes is not easy to find in my whole area. Only Annie-1 has the most acceptable yet not the best. I won't mind going to Kafei Dian for quick meals. Today I learnt a new word - sous-vide style!!!

This Kafei Dian place sounds like another Tastes Good chain where their menus run into many pages with huge exciting photos to lure me. Ended up I only enjoyed their boiled eggs and Wanton Mee very much. Their signature Toasted Bread with Kopi-O is worth dying for as they use a huge charcoal grill to toast at the entrance. I will be there to dine in again since my wife's new center is in that area. Hooray!
I see you like your half-boiled eggs piping hot too....and, no, I don't gulp them down at one go (like you) coz it'll burn my tongue (lol)...but I do slurp them in one go (like the Japanese) if it happens to be a chilled onsen tamago! ;) Yes, I've eaten the yam cake at Annie 1 and it's good.

I've heard of Good Taste chain of restaurants but not Tastes Good. If you meant Good Taste, I remember trying the one in Aeon Maluri just before the pandemic started but ended up not liking the food (it has closed down since). I've a pretty good toasted bread (yes, must be toasted in a conventional charcoal grill) shop in my neighbourhood for my eggs + toast combo fix. ^_*I see you like your half-boiled eggs piping hot too....and, no, I don't gulp them down at one go (like you) coz it'll burn my tongue (lol)...but I do slurp them in one go (like the Japanese) if it happens to be a chilled onsen tamago! ;) Yes, I've eaten the yam cake at Annie 1 and it's good.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Thursday, 12 August 2021",#ewew cooks Siakap a Few Ways,"Since the pandemic started and with the numerous lockdowns and various MCOs that we've been subjected to, I've hardly had the opportunity to go to my usual wet market vendor to get fresh fish and prawns.  I'm not talking about the small wet market in my neighbourhood but a slightly bigger wet market in a neighbouring taman (housing area).
Instead, I've had to settle for frozen fish delivery from Vfresh....but the experience wasn't always positive.  I know I can't compare frozen with fresh but I'd still want it to be at least of acceptable freshness.  Nothing beats fresh fish from the wet markets which I much prefer but (from experience) I've come to realise that their farm-raised fish is a better bet than wild-caught fish (aka fish from the sea)....and I now only limit myself to buying salmon, tilapia or siakap from Vfresh.
And here are just some of the ways I would cook the frozen siakap (also called Asian Sea Bass or Barramundi) that I get, RM13/pc (about 500g, good enough for 2 portions).  These recipes were chosen to ensure the taste does not suffer too much in case the frozen fish is not always as sufficiently fresh as we'd like it to be.",#1 - Steamed Asian Sea Bass Thai-Style#1 - Steamed Asian Sea Bass Thai-Style,"One of the popular ways of cooking a fresh piece of whole siakap is to steam it Thai-style.  In Thai restaurants, you'd usually get a steamed whole fish and served fancily in an elevated fish-shaped pan over a small flame (to keep the fish hot while you eat just like Chinese-style steamed fish).
But here I'm doing it with (half a) frozen Asian see bass (about 300g)...and mine is not so fancy-lah....served on a plate only (haha!).  Although I was quite happy with the freshness of this piece of frozen sea bass, a recipe like this is able to mask any fishiness that the fish may have with a sauce/broth that has the sourness of lime juice, pungency of freshly chopped garlic and fieriness of red/green bird's eye chillies.
You can use plain water for the sauce but a chicken stock will certainly elevate the taste.  If you don't have a ready-made chicken stock in hand, fret not as you can just dissolve some chicken stock powder in water for a happy medium (and a much simpler preparation).
For the sauce, just boil 1/2 tsp chicken stock powder with 1 cup of water (about 250ml) and add some sugar (palm sugar if you have, I used 1 tsp regular sugar).  Once the sugar is dissolved, let it cool slightly before adding finely chopped garlic (3 cloves), bird's eye chillies (I used 1 red + 3 green) and chopped coriander along with the juice of 1 lime (about 3 tsp) and fish sauce (if you have, otherwise 2 tsp Chinese soy will do). The sauce ingredients is an estimate, find the right balance for your taste buds depending if you like it more sour, sweet, spicy or salty (which is the hallmark of any Thai dish).
Stir and do a test taste...it should be sour but balanced with a hint of sweetness.  Tweak the seasoning until you get the balance right and once you're happy with the outcome, pour it over your steaming hot fish (with a little bit more fresh coriander on top).  I was more than happy with the subtle sweetness, mild and delicate flavour of the sea bass coupled with the refreshing, uplifting sauce which is more like a soup really. My broth may look a little darker than the usual Thai-style steamed fish but that's because I didn't use Thai fish sauce which is lighter coloured than Chinese soy.  Half a siakap fillet is the perfect portion for one person with a bowl of rice...yum! ;)",#2 - Pan-Fried Spiced Barramundi with Potato Salad,"If you get your hands on a fresh piece of barramundi fillet, you don't have to do much to it really.  Just pan-fry with salt and black pepper is good enough but since mine is frozen, I added more robust seasonings like garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and dried parsley.  This is like my take on a seriously muted Carribbean-style pan-fried fish (minus the hot peppers...haha!).
I served this with a potato salad of boiled potato chunks and blanched green beans.  I decided to ""listen"" to David Rocco to skip the heavy mayo to go with this lighter version tossed in olive oil, lemon juice (I used limes) and minced garlic (well, just a touch David says but, hey, we're Chinese...and we love our garlic!) seasoned with salt and freshly cracked black pepper which turned out light and delicious.
The fish had a light crisp on the skin (I didn't dust it with some type of flour before shallow frying, otherwise the skin would have been crispier).  Seasoning the fish with a good dose of herbs and spices is a good way to cook frozen fish to take away the fishy taste (if any).  This makes for a super healthy light lunch served with an equally healthy potato salad (you know I need my potatoes for a fuller meal). ^.^",#3 - Stir-Fried Black Pepper Siakap with Capsicum & Onions,"Buoyed by the tastiness of my recent black pepper pork stir-fry, I did the same with the frozen siakap I had in my freezer.  Cooking frozen fish that may not be as fresh with black pepper is a good way to hide the fishiness (and this piece I got from Vfresh was, let's just say, less desirable). >_<
I dusted the siakap slices (try not to cut too thinly) with some cornflour before pan-frying them separately in some oil.  This was because siakap can be quite flaky and moving it around too much during the stir-frying process will certainly break up the fish.

Then I sauteed some chopped onions till soft and translucent before adding the cubed green and red capsicum.  Don't overcook the capsicums as they should stay relatively crunchy to the bite.  Return the cooked fish slices followed by freshly cracked (or coarsely pounded) black pepper.  You can add as much black pepper as you like, a drizzle of dark soy (just a little for colour) and season with salt.  Just mix everything in gently (without stirring the fish slices too much otherwise the fish will disintegrate to small pieces) and the end result is a dish that's both pretty and colourful.",#4 - Fried Siakap with Fresh Chilli Paste#4 - Fried Siakap with Fresh Chilli Paste,"Actually, one of the best ways to use a piece of frozen siakap that isn't of the best quality is to deep-fry it. The fishiness in a crispy, deep-fried fish is not as apparent as when the fish is steamed or stir-fried.  On most days, serving it simply in a sauce of oil, soy and fried garlic or fried ginger shreds is already good enough.
But not this time, as I was feeling slightly more hardworking, so I cooked it with a spicy fresh chilli paste. You just need to saute the chilli paste in oil until it darkens and smells fragrant.  I added a little bit of water to make the sauce slightly wetter.  Spoon it over the fried fish and top it with some fried ginger shreds.
I really enjoyed this one with crispy skin and moist, flaky meat. ^o^  The slightly spicy chilli paste (and ginger shreds) made the fish very appetising indeed and, at the same time, masked any evident fishiness that may be present.
Another good idea is to get your favourite vegetable curry from a restaurant or chap fan stall and add your own fish at home (unless you know how to make a good curry and you don't mind the work entailed in making one from scratch).  The spicy curry will help to drown out any lingering fishiness.  This is what I call a cheat dish but it works too...lol.
Even if we can't get the freshest fish (during these pandemic times when the wet markets are closed), we can still do something worthwhile and turn it into something delicious...we just need to be smart on how best to cook the frozen fish for a good outcome.  Hopefully, some of the ideas/recipes I've shared here will inspire you to cook a fish dish even if you have less than stellar quality fish. ^_~","Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: #ewew cooks, #ewew cooks: Seafood",11 comments:,"I like all your siakap dishes, especially the first one because it has loads of coriander hee..hee... followed by the fried siakap with fresh chili paste, stir fried black pepper siakap and pan fried spiced Barramundi. I haven't bought anything from VFresh for quite some time now mostly because my freezer is quite full. Perhaps when I have the opportunity I will try the siakap. I have never done steamed fish the way you do, only tried plain steamed salmon.
Actually, this is my first time trying this style of steaming (I usually make steamed fish with soy sauce and garlic or onion oil)...and found it to be really good (especially for coriander lovers like us). Your top two picks also happens to be my top favourites too.
Talking about fish today, I have fish in my blog post too! I am good with names of fish, those which I am familiar with are salmon, codfish, sea bass, batang fish and pomfret. All your 4 dishes of fish look so presentable and yummy. Got standard lah. I love to have some coriander on my fish. My votes go to your fish dish #1 and #3 as I love flavourful dishes and Thai style steamed fish. Slurps!
Yes, I just read that post of yours (I see you ate sea bass too). I'm better at fish names than recognising the fish. So many of them look almost the same that it's difficult to differentiate them. My fish dishes got standard?...why, thank you for your compliments! ^_~
I always thought that Thai style steamed fish is fish + gravy steaming together, now I know how it works, hehe :P
I always steam it when I bought whole Siakap, easy and simple aka lazy, LOL
I like the look of your black pepper fish fillet but I never fillet the whole fish myself, does it difficult to work on?
I'm not sure if that's how the fish is done (but I did see it done this way in one of the recipes I saw online). Perhaps, there are those who'd steam it together too but I thought it'd be best to discard the murky liquid that comes out of steamed fish, otherwise the broth will not be as clear.
Oh no, I'm not that skillful lah to fillet a whole fish myself (I leave that to the Masterchef contents...lol). My bought fish comes already filleted (I've now included a pic of the frozen fish fillet into my post just so you can see how it looks like when it arrives).
*correction, typo error, I am not good with the names of fish lol
Many are in the same boat :)
I was once very familiar with eating frozen fishes and seafood when I was a student in US as many states do not have ocean. I was taken aback to see everyone eaten fake crab meat too. In the end I had to eat fish at restaurants or boarding school's cafeteria. I only bought chicken and pork to cook later on.
It is a blessing to have real wet wet markets in Malaysia! Vfresh is definitely the best answer for now.

I love to eat fish more than any other meat like chicken or pork. Deep fried fishes are my top favourite as I could chew all the fins and tails until skeleton left. Hahaha.

Your steamed Asian Sea Bass Thai Style is definitely appetizing with all the generous sprinkled coriander, garlic, chillies and lime juice sauce. I miss my Mama!!! Aroi mak mak.

Fried Siakap with fresh chilli paste is another yummy dish of yours, I could finish a whole siakap like this because it has been deep fried and fragrant.

Tomorrow I will go to Hero Market instead of wet market to buy siakap fish! I am avoiding our wet market due to frequent Covid cases.
Ahh, fish is also my first choice for proteins and love it over other meat just like you...and I also super love fish if they're deep-fried or pan-fried for that crispy edge.

Sorry-lah that my Thai-style fish stirred up memories of your mother. I'm sure you miss her very much and miss her steamed fish too.

Siakap fish is not one I'd get from the wet market though as they're sold whole, not filleted like this. I prefer to eat just the flesh with no bones to contend with. ^_~
All the different ways of cooking also I'd not say no to!

"Eat what, Eat where?","Friday, 6 August 2021",Sally's Kitchen Homecooked Food Delivery (for July),"After closing for the first two weeks of MCO 3.0 and about a week during the EMCO, I was thankful that Sally's Kitchen Homecooked Food Delivery has resumed operations once again.  That's good news for those of us who orders from her weekly since they're located in our same neighbourhood.  Good food with no delivery charges is hard to come by these days with food delivery platforms now in such high demand that delivery fees are at its highest with hardly any discounts in delivery charges.
Week 3 of July started with something old, something new, the Curry Chicken & Osmanthus Egg Rice Set @ RM12.  The something new is the osmanthus egg while the something old was the curry chicken from the mee siam with chicken curry kapitan previously.
The only osmanthus I was familiar with is the sweet dessert of transparent osmanthus cake made with osmanthus flower in a jelly-like cake.  Some would even have goji berries or water chestnut in them.  So I was wondering what this osmanthus egg was.....it turned out to be a mixture of scrambled eggs with Chinese dried mushrooms, wood ear fungus, glass noodles, julienned carrot and spring onions that was served on top of a piece of sang choy (lettuce).  It was ok...nothing to be overly excited about.
The curry chicken was pretty much the same in flavour with the previous curry chicken kapitan.  It was still thick and delicious...and I fully welcomed a bit more potatoes this time round.  Knowing how good the curry chicken was from past experience, I did not hesitate to get an extra a la carte portion @ RM8 for our dinner later that day.
A rather generous portion as you can see...this was almost two portions of chicken curry (drumstick & thigh) which I reheated for our dinner (as I only ate one piece of chicken & potato for my lunch earlier in the day).  
That same week, Sally's Kitchen also had for sale their Hae Bee Sambal @ RM12 (for 150g), a classic Nyonya dried shrimp sambal.  This slightly spicy dried shrimp sambal is made with the pounding or blending of lots of dried shrimps (har mai) and frying it with a chilli paste until dry.  So far, their attempts at the dishes they put out have turned out mostly successful but (unfortunately) I can't say the same for their hae bee sambal.
How good a hae bee sambal really depends on how good the quality of the dried shrimps are...and this one fell short.  It was also missing that chilli oil to make it more fragrant.  I have to say my mom makes a much better dried shrimp belacan sambal (har mai ma lai chan lat chiew).  When we visit her, she would make extra tubs for us to take home.  It's so good, I even spread it over a piece of cucumber...simplicity at its best!
It was very easy for me to assemble this look-alike nasi lemak (but with plain rice lah) for our dinner that day with their curry chicken and dried shrimp sambal by just throwing in some fried ikan bilis, hard-boiled egg and cucumber slices.
The following week saw Chinese Pork Chop Rice @ RM12 featured with sides of potatoes & onions in a sweet and sour gravy with stir-fried mixed vegetables of cauliflower, broccoli, carrot and shimeji mushrooms.   I liked that there was a variety of vegetables and they were cooked until soft. 
The fried pork chop was cooked in a sweet and sour gravy along with potatoes and onions.  The pork chop was lean but sufficiently tender.  This dish is quite similar to sweet and sour pork except you'll be missing a bit of that crispiness you'd get with the smaller chunks of pork since this was done with a piece of pork chop.
The second option for the week was Nasi Goreng Kampong Inchi Kabin @ RM12 which paired a nasi goreng kampong (fried rice) with deep fried chicken marinated in spices served with fried egg, anchovies & sambal belacan.  Inchi Kabin is typically a Nyonya version of fried chicken and this one was well executed.  Even though the chicken didn't arrive fully crispy, it still had good flavours and the portion was really generous with 3 good-sized pieces of chicken from the chicken thigh/leg section.
Besides the Nyonya fried chicken, you also get a decently cooked nasi goreng kampung with two large prawns (it had the crunch like frozen prawns but at least it had the taste of prawns), a fried egg, crispy ikan bilis and a sambal belacan (the same one served with the previous Nyonya lobak set).  If that is not value for money, I don't know what is.
That same week saw a third dish offered (for the first time), Zha Jiang Mian @ RM9.90 with minced pork & potatoes served over a bed of noodles with sides of pickled radish, julienned cucumber & carrots.  Zha Jiang Mien (or Char Cheong Meen) is a popular noodle dish from China that's often referred to as Beijing Fried Sauce Noodles.  It's a dish where thick, flour-based noodles are tossed with a rich, meaty sauce (usually pork mince) along with finely shredded cucumber and carrot.
The sauce is usually made with a sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce and ground bean sauce (made from fermented yellow soybeans that's saltier and less sweet).  The thick meat sauce was generous and plentiful but I found tiny cubes of potatoes in it (which I initially thought were pork lard bits at first glance).  I don't think this would be in a typical char cheong meen dish, right?
I did enjoy the wide, flat and chewy noodles which were cooked right.  Though the meaty sauce tasted decent, it didn't quite taste the same nor look as dark as some char cheong meen recipes I've eaten (the one I had in Esquire Kitchen comes to mind).  Then again, I'm no authority on zha jian mian since I hardly eat this type of noodle.
The menu for the final week of July kicked off with a repeated dish of Thai Green Curry @ RM13 with sides of Onion Omelette and Stir-Fried Long Beans & Carrot.  The Thai Green Curry was one of the first things I tried (and liked) from Sally's Kitchen, so I reordered when the dish came round again.
This time, the green curry came with added softened cabbage besides brinjal.  Unlike previously, there weren't quite enough brinjal + it was cooked too soft (coz the pieces were cut smaller) until it kind of disintegrated into the curry.  The green curry was still delicious, just not as good as I remembered when I had it the first time.  It was missing a bit of that green curry paste flavour as I tasted creamy santan more than anything else.
Another choice for the week was this Braised Hakka Pork Belly with Stir-Fried Green Vegetables @ RM12.  It arrived in a long plastic container with 3 compartments (I've to say I've not seen a container like this before). Hey, this will come in handy as a recycled container to tapau chap fan (of 3 dishes).  This is one food delivery that have their food packaged in many types of containers. 
The Hakka Char Yoke or braised pork belly was excellent...the half lean, half fat chunky pieces of pork and black fungus were nicely tender and the delicious sauce, with a hint of Chinese cooking wine, was good...maybe just a teeny-weeny bit salty but that will be taken care of when eaten with rice.  I liked that the pork belly this round was not as fatty as the previous Braised Mui Choy with Pork dish.  I also preferred this to their previous Hakka Fried Pork.
The stir-fried greens turned out to be tenderly soft Hong Kong Choy Sum with crispy fried shallots.  A nice touch to round off the meal...just wished there was more of it.
The final menu for July was this Fried Meehoon with Dried Shrimps with Curry Vegetables & Fried Wontons @ RM12 served with a dipping of fresh red bird's eye chillies and soy sauce.
The white-coloured fried meehoon with omelette shreds was not oily and good even on its own (for me) though others would most probably prefer to eat it with the vegetable curry for more flavour.  The fried wontons arrived fully crispy with a pork mince filling...nice and crispy, nothing to fault.
The vegetable curry was really good with ingredients of softened potatoes, carrots, long beans, cabbage, brinjal, ladies finger and beancurd puffs.  If there's one thing they do well, it's their curries! ;)
Again, Sally's Kitchen has come through for me in helping me solve what to eat (and not having to cook) for at least 3 meals (usually dinner) in a week now that they offer a third dish for Fridays.  Actually, I quite enjoyed their fried rice and fried meehoon which they (surprisingly) did rather well, not too oily or overly savoury. The other would be their deliciously tender Braised Hakka Char Yoke & Black Fungus (with its hint of Chinese rice wine) which certainly deserves to be ranked among their top dishes so far.....with hope of more to come! ^_~","Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: Food Delivery, Food: Chinese",10 comments:,"i just got overwhelmed with all these nice foodies from Sally's Kitchen! The Thai Green curry caught my attention! i miss Thai food very much!
Yeah, Sally's Kitchen has been churning out lots of good dishes. I'm very fortunate I can rely on them for my meals.
Osmanthus Egg does sound very special and exotic. I believe I have eaten osmanthus jelly at some wedding dinner, though I can't say that the taste is very distinct. I guess its presence in the egg is lost. The curry looks as good as it tastes judging from your positive review. Hmmm...the hae bee sambal does not have the right color and did not taste right either. Eh, you want to share your mum's har mai ma lai chan lat chiew recipe? wahahahaha!

I would appreciate the pork chop rice since I love sweet and sour sauce. I don't mind lean meat as long as it is tender and not dry. I think that it goes well with the mixed fried vegetables. I must say that the dish that caught my eye is the Nasi Goreng Kampong Inchi Kabin. Not just the bento container hah..hah..but the chunky chicken pieces and the fried rice with two big prawns. At RM12.00, I say it is a steal! You even get a fried egg, sambal belacan (yum!) and crispy ikan bilis.

That zha jiang mian I have seen before at Esquire Kitchen a long time ago. I meant to give it a try but somehow never did. I think the Koreans have a version of that in the form of jajangmyeon which I'm afraid I don't like.

The Thai Green Curry looks rather pale. I reckon Sally had trouble getting enough basil leaves hence you tasted mostly santan in the curry. Oh! I like Hakka Char Yoke hee..hee.. been a while since I last had it. I agree that Sally could have been more generous with the greens.

The fried meehoon was served with vegetable curry, quite an unusual combo but I would be happy with that. It's nice that the fried wontons arrive crispy because usually these things get soft by the time they are delivered.

I am sure that Sally's other customers also appreciate her cooking as much as you do and that would surely keep her in business and keep her customers very happy. If I had a Sally in my taman, I would also order very frequently!
Oh, there's no osmanthus (flower) in the egg mixture actually. It's just the name of the dish (the way it's served mimics the osmanthus jelly cake only). I, too, thought the colour of the sambal was off when I opened it. I would share my mom's ma lai chan lat chiew if I had the recipe but you know-lah, the generation before us like to cook with an agak-agak recipe...lol.

All that for RM12 is unbelievable, right? ;)

I would think that the Korean version sounds about right...from the similar name of jajangmyeon! ;) Oh, you're not a fan either?

I see, the basil leaves is what gives the green curry paste its flavour and colour. My sister-in-law said the day they had it, his son asked when the green curry looks like grey(ish) curry...wakakakaka! :D

That's my advantage of living in the same neighbourhood where Sally's Kitchen is HQed, I get my wontons crispy from the wok.

I'm very lucky to have a Sally in my taman...maybe one day you will too :)
You mentioned that you ordered green curry for your meals, now I see it in your post. You ordered and tried quite a variety from rice to noodles to beehoon. I would say my favorite goes to the braised pork belly rice. You are right to say hard to find food delivery services that do not charge for delivery. Foodpanda delivery charges are so high!
With our unending MCOs, FoodPanda can now afford to charge higher delivery fees with more people opting for food deliveries these days. There are practically no food delivery services that don't charge delivery fees nowadays. I happen to be living in the same housing area as this one, that's why delivery is foc.
It is so nice to hear that Sally's Kitchen is back in action to feed the neighbourhood. This time, I could see how convenient when it comes to meals as they would deliver at no extra cost all the warm and delicious meals. I have no objection to her cooking and like almost all of them. Now it has become a tiresome chore just to plan nightly what I would be eating the next day for lunch and dinner that would please me so that I would not sink into depression.

This Curry Chicken & Osmanthus Egg Rice Set sounds delicious but it turns out to be nothing to be excited. Yeah, I love to eat them when served as jelly in restaurants. I started to search online where I could buy Osmanthus Jelly after seeing your post. Still undecided as I only found one supplier from JB.

Aha!!! I must try to make Hae Bee Sambal since I am in the frenzy mood now to make condiments or whatever that could please my appetite. My wife is allergy to shrimps but I am not. It is appetizing to eat that Hae Bee Sambal with just plain rice.

I really miss eating Zha Jiang Mian very-very much now. I used to eat them weekly at Esquire Kitchen when my parents were alive. They were fussy eaters, so I had to keep bringing them to their favourite places only.

Vegetable Curry!!! Bring on. I love to eat them piping hot with plain rice. Yums.

You are so blessed to have Sally's Kitchen as your own kitchen. Me envy lo.
Of course it had to be no delivery charges for me-lah since I'm living in the same taman as Sally...hehehe! ;) Yeah, thinking of what to eat or what to cook is quite tiresome with this extended round of MCO.

I wouldn't know how to make osmanthus jelly.

Yes, I saw your homemade condiments...you're quite adapt at making sambal belacan. Next you can try this hae bee sambal...to eat with just plain rice and cucumber...yum.

Ah, you like zha jiang mian. When comes to Esquire Kitchen, all the old folks like this place...a household name.

Aiyo, not my own kitchen-lah...but a kitchen near enough for me to just tekan-tekan my phone and hot meals will arrive at my doorstep...kekeke! ^_~
Osmanthus egg is direct translated from its Cantonese name Guai Fa Dan or Guai Fa Chi where ""Guai Fa"" is Osmanthus and Guai Fa Chi contains ""sharkfin"" which usually appeared as on of the dishes on cold platter during wedding dinner.
If there's an option of fried chicken, I'll no hesitation to choose that, so the kampong fried rice with inchi kabin would be my choice. :P I can't resist fried chicken.
I like the gravy of the Hakka Char Yoke, doused on the rice, yum...

Thanks for your explanation. Oh, no wonder I remember eating this dish as part of the hot & cold platter at dinner functions before...and yes, it usually has sharksfin stir-fried together with it.
Who can resist fried chicken anyway...hehe! ^_*
Yes, the gravy of Hakka Char Yoke is so tasty and flavourful, I make sure every drop of it is in my rice...hah..hah.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Wednesday, 28 July 2021",#ewew makes Salads but not Salad Dressings,"One of my favourite meals to have is a salad....but not any salad though.  I'm not a big fan of raw salads, at least not 100% raw.  I used to rely on triple washed mixed salad leaves straight out of a packet for my salads but that was before I discovered the deliciousness of roasted or chargrilled vegetables (and for that, I have phonghongbakes to thank).
Since learning how to make grilled vegetables, I'd much prefer to eat my own cooked salads nowadays...or a salad combination of cooked and raw ingredients is fine too (we don't want to be grazing like a goat according to choiyen.com)....lol!
As much as I like to make and eat salads, I don't make my own salad dressings.  Why would I when I can conveniently pour or squeeze out my favoured dressings direct from a bottle...and that dressing is none other than Kewpie dressing, of course.
But if I did make my own salad dressing, it'll probably be the simplest one with olive oil, lemon juice, honey and a little bit of crushed garlic.  Even before I started buying bottled dressings, I would buy those dressings in small packets or get a salad which comes with a packet of dressing inside.  Now that I eat salads more often and prefer my own cooked salads than raw salad leaves, obviously getting bottled dressings make more sense.
The first Kewpie dressing I tried was Kewpie's Roasted Sesame Dressing.  The first time I had it, I really liked it a lot.  Then the overly robust flavours of the roasted sesame got to me and I couldn't bring myself to finish the last bottle I got.
So, I moved on to Kewpie's Thousand Island Dressing.  Now I've always loved Thousand Island dressing as it's the one I'm always drawn to when I find myself at the salad counters of buffets even when there were loads of other dressings I could choose from.
Thousand Island has always been my no. 1 favourite dressing and Kewpie's Thousand Island Dressing is light and tangy and not too sourish or too sweet.
I'm all for anything that's tangy and zesty as I find the dressing stimulates my appetite especially on days when I don't have much of an appetite.
Then I saw this Hellman's Smoky Thousand Island Dressing advertisement on Astro.  Since I love Thousand Island dressing, I thought why not try a different brand.
Hellman's Smoky Thousand Island Dressing has a much thicker consistency than Kewpie's and also a more robust and punchy flavour.  Because of this, you can afford to put less dressing otherwise it can be a little cloying if you put too much.
And because this one is smoky Thousand Island, I did get that light smoky taste which differentiates it from Kewpie's.  It's not as light as Kewpie's and I also find it a little sweeter, so go easy on the amount.
One day when I was browsing through the supermarket, I noticed a new roasted sesame dressing, Kewpie's Roasted Sesame Dressing with Yuzu Taste.  This must be their new take on their regular roasted sesame dressing which now comes with yuzu flavour.
After finding Kewpie's Roasted Sesame Dressing too salty for my taste buds (I suppose you could add some honey to balance out the saltiness), I'm glad to say it is now back in favour with me but only the one that says Kewpie's Roasted Sesame Dressing with Yuzu Taste.
That fruity, light tartness of yuzu (I find) cuts through the saltiness of the roasted sesame which makes it appetite inducing and that much more welcoming in taste.
Besides my 'go to' favourite trio of salad dressings, I also have a trio of seasonings that I must have in my pantry at all times and these staples are McCormick's Black Peppercorn Grinder, Sea Salt Grinder and Garlic Pepper Seasoning Grinder (grinder versions only...hehe).
Before they had the grinder version, I used to buy ground black pepper to sprinkle on my mushroom soup or any other types of soup before realising that the black pepper was too fine.  Then I changed to coarse black pepper and found it to be more fragrant and you can actually taste the black pepper coz it's coarse.  Of course they also sold whole black peppercorns which was wonderful coz nothing beats freshly cracked black pepper but it was inconvenient to have to put it into a grinder of our own.
So, when whole peppercorns came packaged together with an all-in grinder, it was ingenious!  The smell of freshly cracked black pepper is just different...and I love the sound of pepper being grinded like it's so authentic...lol.  There's even a setting (three actually) as to how fine you want your black pepper, so you can have it really fine or coarse as you wish.  I've not bought any other bottle ever since.  Yes, I pay a little bit more for this convenience but it's so worth it.  Forget about those bottles of ground black pepper, coarse black pepper or whole black peppercorns....just get this everything-in-one (with grinder function) will suffice! ^_~
The same goes for the sea salt grinder which I like to use this for my western cooking coz it's not as salty as table salt (which I use for Chinese cooking) + it just sounds that much more genuine when you grind it out from a bottle! :D  That way your family or guests also get to tweak the food to the level of saltiness they desire.

The final bottle is just a combination of black pepper, sea salt and garlic (+ red & green bell peppers) that I like to use to season almost anything and everything.  I use them as seasonings for meats, potatoes and vegetables....I sometimes even sprinkle them on fries and fresh salads! ;)
When it comes to the protein component of any salad, nothing beats a freshly roasted, tender and juicy chicken leg.  Of course you'll need to shred or tear out the meat from the chicken leg.
If I don't make roasted chicken, a protein of grilled or pan-fried chicken tenderloin will do just as well too for me.  Some salads are so good on its own, I don't even need a dressing...lol.
The other protein I like to use are sauteed large, juicy, charred prawns but I don't know if that qualifies as a prawn salad....or a prawn dish?  Kekeke!
Of course, bacon is another excellent choice as a protein.
And when you really don't have any protein in your fridge, even potatoes and hard-boiled eggs will do fine too.

For the vegetable component, it's quite obvious (from the photos of my salads) that I tend to use the same few ones which I think work really well in a salad of roasted vegetables and they include broccoli, cauliflower, red & green capsicum (all colours but red is my ultimate favourite because of the sweetness it brings), onions, cherry tomatoes and fresh button mushrooms.
And the best thing is, roasted vegetable salads keep really well as leftovers.  If kept in the fridge, you just need to reheat it in the toaster oven and it'll be as good as new.
When I get tired of cooking, tired of eating my own cooking or don't know what to cook, a salad is what I'd fall back on all the time.  Not only is it easy to make, it's nutritious, it's healthy and it keeps well as leftovers. It's great as a main meal or a side dish to your main meal. ^o^","Email ThisEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: #ewew cooks, #ewew cooks: Salads",10 comments:,"Kewpie is one of my favorites when it comes to salad dressing. Yet to happen to see the other brand, Hellman, in our supermarket. As salad is light, I must have some proteins in it if not I would go hungry easily after eating it as I am a big eater. Potatoes and hard boiled eggs would make a good alternative too. Sometimes I like to add some raisins to my salad.

Did you make all those salads shown here? They look so yummy.
Heheh, I did make all those salads shown here (it's an infringement to copy & paste other people's cooked food into my blog without crediting the source). ^_*

For me, I still go hungry easily (after about 2 hours) after eating a salad even if there's a protein in it (I need carbs!), so I'd usually split my salad into two portions and eat them over two sessions. ^.^
As usual, a lengthy post for salad. ^_^
Just like I've mentioned in my ""grazing like a goat"" post (I'm really impressed with your memory as myself don't even remember I wrote that before ~>_<~), I'm not really a salad person but due to diet and its flexibility and rather hassle free preparation, I'll have salad as my bento lunch at office at least twice a week.
Are those salad meals for your family or yourself only? Because I don't think your hubby like salad meal, just like my hubby, unless it is as side for a mains.
I used to buy the McCormick's Black Peppercorn Grinder, but I found that it's more economical if I buy a grinder and peppercorn separately because the selling price of those all-in-grinder is included, so why not I just buy mine and I can continuously use.
I like Kewpie sesame sauce too, but really dare not to put too often and usually I eat my salad ""kosong"" means without any sauce, because the main reason I'll have salad because of diet but creamy sauce like sesame, mayo or thousand island are quite fattening. >_<
You know me, my posts are always lengthy...and I equally like lengthy replies as well. ^_~
Actually, my memory is not that good but I found your link in one of my previous salad posts, so I included it in this one too.
Oh, on the contrary, my hubby do eat salads as long as they're roasted and not raw leaves but, of course, a main will make it even better.
I did try one with my own bought grinder but it didn't work as well (maybe I got a lousy grinder), so I gave up and resorted to the grinder that comes with it (that way I can keep tab on the expiry date too).
Yeah, I agree that creamy sauces are fattening, that's why it's key to dress your salads lightly. I don't need much (can eat 'kosong' also) but need just a little to amp up the taste! ;)
I love your colorful salads! It is true that since we can get delicious salad dressings, there is no need to make our own. I have developed an aversion towards the Kewpie Roasted Sesame dressing, I can't explain why. I also tried the one with yuzu but I disliked it. I also tried Kewpie Thousand Island and also did not like it. Haiz! I haven't made roasted vegetables in a while and I might get back to that for my food prep. Can I say that you prefer creamy dressings as opposed to vinaigrette? I like Hellman's Thousand Island the best but their roasted sesame dressing is not good - too strong on the sesame smell. Ah! I also like salt and pepper that come in a grinder! I think I shall make roasted vege salad soon as I am very inspired by this post!
Eh, I thought you loved the roasted sesame dressing...not anymore? Like me, it tasted so good in the beginning but now I've also developed an aversion towards it but, at least, I can eat the yuzu version now but still prefer their Thousand Island which I find it's lighter than Hellman's (I think you prefer more robust sauces). I actually like vinaigrettes more than creamy dressings (not white ones though) but don't know how to make good vinaigrettes (they always end up too sour since I tend to hold back on the sugar/honey at home). >_< Both of us liking salt & pepper grinders means we're too lazy to use our own grinders and prefer the use and discard method! :D Glad to have inspired you to make roasted veggie salads again...hee..hee! ^_*
What a delicious post featuring the brilliant ideas to make our own roasted or chargrilled vegetables! I have been eating raw green leafy salads like a goat and was delighted when I rarely chanced on eating roasted or chargrilled vegetables. The last time I guess was eating the platter dish at Morganfield's which had some grilled salad. I thought it was very nice and made me happy but never thought I could try making them at home. I will add chicken meat with assorted vegetables and maybe fruits to make them sweeter! Kewpie thousand island is always available in my fridge. I don't think I will make my own salad sauce as I hardly eat salads though I love them. Thank you!
The Kewpie Thousand Island dressing you like will lend sweetness already to your grilled salad, no need for fruits. Why don't you surprise your wife and make this roasted vegetable salad for her since it's so easy to do...all you need is olive oil, salt & pepper...and put to roast/grill in the oven...that's it! ;)
You know for a long time I thought this brand was from Japan. lol.
It isn't? Then, why is there a Kewpie Corp HQ in Japan (offering more or less the same products on their website)? Perhaps it's some kind of JV to manufacture it here locally? I guess it doesn't matter where it's from as long as it tastes good...lol.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Monday, 19 July 2021",Nasi Lemak Bamboo @ SS2 PJ,"When phonghongbakes wrote a post on Nasi Lemak Bamboo @ SS2 PJ, I knew it would only be a matter of time before I ventured there coz I love to eat nasi lemak to begin with + it's located on a jalan (road) which is a familiar hunting ground for us when it comes to food.
Originating from Sabah, this flavour of Sabahan reached our shores with their first branch outside of Sabah in PJ (opened in late November 2020).  They have since opened another branch in Sri Petaling with more franchise outlets to open soon.
We actually came here twice.  The first was a disappointment because we found a queue waiting to be seated...and we didn't want to wait.  The second time, we arrived not long after they were opened and found no queue.  We got one of the last available tables...and that's when I noticed everyone who was sitting down wasn't eating yet coz the 'queue' has moved inside...meaning everyone was 'queuing' inside instead for their food...lol!
Well, at least queuing when one is seated isn't that bad.  The shop is basically self service, so you need to order at the counter and self pick up your food and drinks from two different counters.  I would have preferred for the food to be served to us at the table.
Well, our first order has to be none other than their Nasi Lemak Bamboo Kari Seafood @ RM16.90 as that's obviously what they're best known for (otherwise it wouldn't be in the shop's name...hehe!).  This was how it was served.  It arrived with an inverted bamboo on a rattan tray lined with waxed paper laden with the usual toppings of hard-boiled egg, fried ikan bilis & peanuts, cucumber and sambal.
When I lifted up the bamboo cylinder, the contents melimpah keluar (flowed out) with steaming hot rice mixed with prawns, sotong (squid) and sambal that was wrapped in banana leaves.  They made this by lining the hollow bamboo with banana leaves before filling it up with cooked rice and seafood curry to be steamed.
You know me, the food already gets off to a flying start when it arrives piping hot.  The seafood of squid and prawns were adequately fresh and it was a generous amount of seafood for the price.
The medium-sized prawns had a slightly (very slight) bouncy texture when I bit into it and were only mildly sweet, not near the low quality of frozen prawns but also not quite the good quality, sweet tasting fresh prawns that I know.
What looked like small squids turned out to be baby cuttlefish.  They seemed like baby octopus initially but taking a closer look and based on size of the tentacles to body ratio, they're more likely to be baby cuttlefish (they call it sotong katak?).  The cuttlefish had a nice, soft texture.
The seafood curry is very light tasting, not the robustly flavoured kari we know, so those expecting traditional curry flavours will be disappointed.  The curry has this light, sourish tang to it (with kaffir lime leaves)...nothing quite like a savoury curry but I quite enjoyed it eaten together with the sambal.  The sambal is more on the sweet side rather than spicy which works for me but some will prefer it spicier and more savoury (like my husband).  Mix the curry with the sambal for a delicious mouthful.
I wanted to try the Nasi Lemak Ayam Rendang for our other choice but it was not available that morning.  Not sure why since we were there when they opened shop, so they couldn't have run out of it already.  Perhaps it wasn't ready yet which leads to the next question....why wasn't it ready? >_<
So, we chose the Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng @ RM12.90 instead.  It was served with a whole fried chicken leg with the same condiments of hard-boiled egg, fried crispy anchovies & peanuts, cucumber and sambal.
The coating on the deep-fried whole chicken leg was very crunchy but the meat could do with more seasoning and flavour (according to my spouse) though it was alright for me.  The batter coating of this fried chicken is crunchy but a bit hard and seemed a little over-fried.  It's not as good as Village Park's Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng (which I prefer) where the batter coating is finer and much crispier with better flavours in both the coating and the meat.
I was able to taste the santan in the rice a bit more with this one coz it was not doused in the seafood curry. The ikan bilis weren't of the best quality though they managed to be crispy but a tad hard.
I ordered a Mee Siam Kosong @ RM5 to go (for my lunch later).  The plain mee siam came with a few slivers of omelette.  The mee siam may look deceptively simple but I did enjoy it as the flavours were nicely balanced between sour and not too spicy.  Something light and appetite inducing.
The Hainan Kopi (Cold) @ RM3.50 is as decent as it can be for an establishment like this.  They also have on their menu mee rebus, soto ayam, sotong goreng, cucur udang, otak-otak, cendol, soft-boiled eggs & Hainanese toast.  They've recently added nasi lemak rendang daging to the menu (now this I'm interested).",My Personal Opinion,"For me, it's the uniqueness of the seafood curry in a bamboo that differentiates it from the rest of the nasi lemak joints (although nasi lemak served in a bamboo isn't something new as it has been done before). Nevertheless, if you're someone who enjoys eating seafood (like me) and who doesn't mind a light tasting, faintly sourish, appetite inducing curry, then this is the very thing you should order when you're here. ^o^
But their ayam goreng is not quite in the same league as say Village Park's fried chicken.  I've not had their nasi lemak ayam rendang and certainly wouldn't mind trying their rendang daging on my next visit.
Overall, it's a pleasant enough nasi lemak (I'm referring to their signature dish, of course) though many will probably say they can find many other better tasting nasi lemak than this.  Nasi lemak is just one of those dishes that everyone tends to have their own favourite and it's difficult to convince them otherwise. ^_~",Nasi Lemak Bamboo,28 Jalan SS2/6647300 Petaling JayaSelangorTel: 016-801 3007,"Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: Food: Malay, Location: PJ SS2, Nasi Lemak",13 comments:,"i saw this nasi lemak bamboo in my Foodpanda listing as their Sri Petaling outlet is quite nearby my place. I have yet to try, though it looks interesting. The way they serve the rice in bamboo reminds me of nasi tonggek.
I had to google to see what nasi tonggek is. I see it's similarly served in a cylinder (albeit a stainless steel one) but the overflowing curry and sambal looks too spicy for me. ^_*
Nasi lemak served in bamboo is something new to me though. I would be interested to try the nasi lemak ayam rendang too as I am a rendang person. Now you made me have craving for nasi lemak
Oh, they don't have that in SG yet then. I like rendang ayam too but love rendang daging even more...hehe. When a craving hits, must satisfy it! ;)
As for me, I would also order otak otak to go with my nasi lemak too.
I also don't mind having otak otak as a side dish but one portion of nasi lemak is already too filling for me.
Ah! So you visited right after I did. I'm glad you got to try their signature Nasi Lemak Bamboo Kari Seafood and enjoyed it. You also found the fried chicken over-fried. Based on my experience the last time, I doubt if my partner would want to visit again. I might ask my brother if he is keen because I want to at least try the Nasi Lemak Bamboo Kari Seafood. I really miss eating out!
Yeah, I probably visited a month after you. I'm not very confident that you'll like the nasi lemak bamboo kari seafood though as the flavours might not be punchy enough for you, so no loss if you have not tried this. :P I really miss eating out too! ;)
When you mentioned about sourish in the curry, it made me reminded of the kari ikan that we had at mamak, which is a bit sourish note too. Only seafood curry served in bamboo like that or it applicable to all curries in the menu?
No, only the seafood curry nasi lemak is served like this...in a bamboo. The light tang in the curry doesn't taste anything like a mamak's fish curry though which has a strong curry powder taste.
What a shame that I have not tried this place so nearby lah. I am excited to see rice being cooked in bamboo which is an ancient rice cooking method in South China and North of Thailand. I will find a way to eat their signature Nasi Lemak Bamboo Kari Seafood using a runner. When you showed everything melimpah keluar, my saliva also mengalir tak henti-henti.

I agree that the fried Chicken at Village Park is top notch because they are really crispy with good & rich seasonings. Imagine how many times Tun M went to eat there with no VVIP treatment which meant he queued and sat on any bangku available. An almost perfect Nasi Lemak is definitely Village Park's well cooked dich right from the fragrant rice till the Ayam Berempah Goreng with all its crispy sides! I love to crunch them like snacks.
I see you like Village Park's ayam goreng berempah too. I doubt Tun M will be made to wait for a seat though.

I don't think you can experience the nasi lemak kari seafood melimpah keluar unless you eat it on site + only then it'll be piping hot from the bamboo. Since Mak Kiah's son says dine-in will be allowed very soon, just be patient and wait a little longer..lol! ;D
There's one in Klang not terribly far from where I stay too, love it.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""","Namelaka Patisserie, Bangsar","Forget the pre cny detox- we always have the appetite for a good dessert, especially ones befitting the season. Namelaka Patisserie is the perfect pick for sweets to kickstart a year of indulgence.  Hidden away on the first floor in Telawi Bangsar, it is easy to missed the staircase leading to a bright and spacious room filled with calm and comfort. Look for the KK mart and the stairways will lead you to the simplicity of natural sweetness that wins my heart.
There is no shortcrust pasty or sweet filling and rich chocolate topping whatsoever, only the finest technique with the most creative input of inspiration gathered from both beauty and imperfection of real fruit. With lots of white chocolate, and celebrating mother nature’s creation of some of the tastiest fruits, Namelaka Patisserie created unique dessert taking form of real fruit accordingly to the flavor of each respective fruits, without even having to plate it to impress their customers. The brilliant twists lie in the form of the dessert molded in 3d and a ganache layer of fresh smooth fillings holding chunks of real fruits encased at the core of each dessert fruit, as this creamy filling hold the shape of the dessert. It will be a real challenge trying to pack this because from what I see, it is best consume in the house. And why not? Since the interior provide nothing but comfy and relaxing as well as sleek clean of immaculate white.
Attention to detail abounds. Passionfruit and pear have the most beautiful exterior and is aesthetically the prettiest if you badly need to feed your camera. Myself is so in love with the sleek green apple but while the names sounded like a breeze, it’s a dish best left to the professionals.
It’s not a cake and it looks almost too pretty to eat, but this fruit dessert is totally extraordinary not only in essence, it comprises real fruit, and when break open, creating an otherworldly confection that simple begs to be photographed.
Don’t forget to enjoy with their cocktail or coffee brew. I find myself drawn to their mocktail mainly thanks to the freshness of mint infused and the frizzy.
Namake is a very new establishment during my visit and more dessert would soon to come. It is not usual that I speak so highly on dessert places but I am liking no artificial sugar added so I am looking forward to what they have next.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""","Bar Patua @ MGM Cotai, Macao (Macau)",Leave a reply,"#sycookiestravelogue, #foodeverywhere #2018macaoyearofgastronomy #experiencemacao #sycookiesxmacao
Macao does casinos and entertainment like no other city. The glam and bling of luminescence and iridescent glow at every single corner reflects the class and hospitality Macao has come to represent. At MGM, the lustrous warren of comfy nooks for wooing, with an elegant even though not as imposing bar to sit at if you like some bartender chat with your drinks- there’s history and storytelling for the tasting notes on what’s offered behind the bar, which might not arouse much interest in wine or beer drinker, but is quite handy for whisky or gin lover.
Serving their signature Portuguese inspired cocktail tonight, the folks behind the bar are all practiced professionals; personable, knowledgeable and looking sharp and handsome in nicely pressed suits. Our mixologist told us quite an interesting story from how Patua Penicillin (MOP 95) came about and how dark rum, scotch, and infusion of lemon, ginger, fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme and dill works their magic as it sits longer before pouring into your drinking glasses. Also serving us a couple of other well- executed drinks like the Bunny Mary (MOP 95), the energy is high in this handsome room filled with sets of modern European.
 





consisting of dark rum, scotch, lemon, ginger, honey syrup, fresh herbs
For those in need of some food, the tapas do the trick. Key to good tapas in my opinion, is all in the combination of skillful cooking and the most convivial of atmospheres if not the sourcing of the finest ingredients; in which Bar Patua absolutely fulfills. They might not strike sourcing of perfect ingredients and very little attention to details when it comes to presentation but combined with the pairing of ethanol compound, it is all good to most people.

Iketeru Japanse Buffet (The Hungry Deal) @ Hilton KLIketeru Japanse Buffet (The Hungry Deal) @ Hilton KL,"By - -October 1, 2019October 1, 2019
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","Many years ago, Iketeru used to serve Japanese buffet and it was on top of my to try list. Iketeru was possibly the best, if not one of the best Japanese restaurants in KL at that time. Their ala carte menu was (and still) quite pricey so having the buffet makes it a more viable option, especially for people young people who could eat a lot.
Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to try the buffet because it was discontinued for a period of time. But good news guys, Iketeru’s Japanese buffet is back – albeit known as The Hungry Deal now.
The main thing you need to know about The Hungry Deal is that it’s an ala carte buffet. So you are presented with a different menu and you can order unlimited servings of each dish.
There’s no time limit per se, as the buffet is served between 12pm and 2.30pm (last order 2pm) in the weekends. The price is RM238++/pax so it’s definitely not cheap. In fact it may be the most expensive Japansee buffet in KL right now.
Probably it’s because of the price, not many people are blogging about it. And FYI this was not an invited review. So if you heard about The Hungry Deal but can’t find any info online, hopefully this entry of mine helps. I have also uploaded a photo album of the full menu so at least you know what to expect from the buffet – menu wise.
As with any Japanse buffet, ordering sashimi is where you make your money back. Iketeru offers 7 types of sashimi which is a lot more compared to most Japanese buffets in KL. Instead of the usual salmon, tuna, tako and butterfish (white tuna), you also get hamachi, shime saba and hokkigai here.
As you can see, we had multiple servings of it. Everything tasted up to standard (for buffet) but we never reordered the butterfish because of reasons you could find via Google.
Teppanyaki is probably the next best item to gorge on after you are bored of the sashimi. Among the list of items available, the Sirloin (Australian Black Angus), halibut and prawn would be the top choices. It’s quite impossible to go wrong with the sirloin as long as you request for the right temperature, eg. no medium well or well done.
It was as tender, juicy and flavorful as you could have dreamed of – beating many “wagyu steaks” I have had so far this year. Teppanyaki sirloin, medium rare, order it as many times as you could eat it, ok?
Not a beef lover? Go for Teppyanyaki Halibut instead. Basically, it tastes like cod with a similar flaky, soft and oily texture.
Teppanyaki prawns were delicious as well, firm and crunchy.
If you love kimchi, you won’t be disappointed with the Kimchi Beef. It’s served medium rare so they are definitely tender. The kimchi was great too, it was exceptionally tangy and spicy – surely a class better than those store bought ones served at the normal Korean restaurants.
Other things we tried included Sanma teriyaki, Tai Kama (sea bream head) shioyaki/teriyaki, soft shell crab/ebi tempura, tai miso shiru (soy bean soup with sea bream head) and a couple of appetizers like chawanmushi and marinated seafood with spice of wasabi.
All of them were not bad but they did not particularly impress us. Some dishes which involved the use of sea bream head were a let down despite tasting good because of they did not scale the fish properly.
We also did not try any of the sushi, rice bowl, noodle or fried items because they are too filling for 2 pax. But if you are dining in a group with more people, then I guess it makes sense to share.
Although dessert is not included in the menu, rest assured you will get it at the end of your meal. It’s an array of ice cream, fruits and cakes served on a boat just like shown above.
Lastly, for the price we paid, we expected attentive and impeccable service from the staff from waiting to serving. Since it’s an ala carte buffet it’s understandable that it will take longer than usual for them to send the dishes out, but to wait for about 20-30 minutes for the first dish to be served is not quite acceptable. Only when the lunch crowd started to disperse that the service really starts to pick up.
I hate to be kiasu, I really do. But in this case, my advice to you is to order more dishes and in more portions to reduce the down time. Although the food is good and we highly enjoyed most of it, the dining experience felt like we were just waiting for most of the time.",Iketeru's The Hungry Deal Menu,Iketeru-The-Hungry-Deal-Japanese-Buffet-Menu Hilton KL,"Here’s the full menu of The Hungry Deal for your reference.

– Mee Kari Sungai Putat
– Warung Hijau
– Mee Udang Kak Rose
– Nasi Ayam Baba
– Satay Kampung Jawa
– Seri Erra Roti John
– Mango Float Royale

Best Yakiniku Restaurants to Eat in KL & Klang ValleyBest Yakiniku Restaurants to Eat in KL & Klang Valley,"By - -July 27, 2017July 27, 2017
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","When it comes to Japanese food in KL, I strongly believe that Yakiniku (Japanese BBQ) is the safest choice because you will rarely go home disappointed. Sure, it’s not always cheap but the chances of you having a bad meal is extremely low.
Many times I have spent hundreds on a super-average Japanese meal which I regretted later and got me thinking “Damn, I should have gone for yakiniku instead”. So, here are 12 yakiniku restaurants that deserve my hard-earned money.

Ukiyo Osaka Yakiniku, Sri Petaling","The newest kid on the block, Ukiyo Osaka Yakiniku is a newly opened Japanese BBQ restaurant in Sri Petaling. They offer a couple of affordable set meals which include high quality ingredients such as supreme ox tongue, premium AUS rib eye, scallops and premium Spanish pork.
You can also get melted Mozzarella cheese to wrap your meats or simply dip seafood into it. A satisfying meal here for two inclusive of rice should not cost you more than RM80.

Yakiniku Toraji, Isetan The Japan Store","Yakiniku Toraji started out in a small backstreet in Ebisu, Tokyo Shibuya in December 1995. They are known for serving thick cuts of meat, which was considered an unusual practice at that time, but the Japanese loved it.
Toraji carefully selects their meat to guarantee freshness and succulence to the bite. Their gas burners are fitted with crystallized marbles under the metal grill to ensure an even heat distribution. That allows the food to cook at the same rate with less chances of burning. To get more bang for your buck, take advantage of their set lunch menu which starts from RM40 per pax. For a more elaborate meal, Toraji offers two course menu.","Yakiniku Toraji @ Isetan The Japan Store, Lot 10","Business hours: 11am – 3pm, 6pm – 11pm

Their simple two page menu features dozens of different cuts of mainly pork, beef, lamb, chicken and seafood.
The sauces and condiments are sweet sauce, lime, salted black pepper and chili powder. The idea is to dip the grilled meat into the sweet sauce followed by a light coating of black pepper and chili powder. You can have a filling meal for 2 here between RM50-RM60, an economic yet delicious choice.",Authentic BBQ 古早烧烤,"Jalan 6/37a, Kawasan Perusahaan Bukit Maluri, 52100 Kepong, KL

The main reason we came to Gyutaro is because it shares the same parent company as Kanichikan Yakiniku (KNK). KNK is our top favorite yakiniku restaurant in KL so that automatically makes Gyutaro a safe choice. And we are glad to be right. You can expect the same excellent quality of food and service here, except that at Gyutaro, the dining atmosphere is more casual.
For a good bang for your buck, you won’t go wrong with the beef tongue/under tongue meat that’s only available in the set lunch menu. Both items are only RM9, definitely value for money.

Their simple one page menu offers beef, chicken, pork, seafood and vegetables that can be grilled on the charcoal fire pot. The most expensive items are wagyu beef cuts clocking at RM45 for short rib or loin, while the rest are between RM12 to RM28.
A ramen shop called Yokohama Ramen & Japanese Curry attached to Yazawa so you can also order ramen to complete your meal. I highly recommend it because a bowl of white rice is ridiculously priced at RM6 a bowl here.",Yazawa BBQ Dining / Yokohama Ramen & Japanese Curry,"2, Jalan Solaris 3, Solaris Mont Kiara, 50480 Mont Kiara

Gyukingu offers a variety of premium meats such as authentic Saga beef from Kyushu island, Australian Wagyu, Angus, Iberico pork, Sakura pork, Australian beef.. and the list goes on.
While you’re here, you MUST try their garlic fried rice @ RM9.30. This undoubtedly is one of the best fried rice (flavourful and full of ‘wok hei’) I have ever had and I was so surprised to find it here.

Gerai Makan Japanese BBQ (Taishu Yakiniku / 大众烧肉), Taman Desa","It’s impossible not to know Taishu Yakiniku, as they are probably the first restaurant to introduce the concept of cheap-and-good Japanese BBQ in KL. The menu is delightfully affordable with more than a dozen of choices of meat, mostly pork options. Price starts at RM5 for the cheaper cuts of meat like offals, RM10 for the normal stuff and RM20 – RM25 for the special stuff.
Besides yakiniku, ramen is also available here in three flavors: pork, chicken and cold. The pork ramen won’t necessarily blow you away, but it’s good enough considering the low price.",大众烧肉 Gerai Makan Japanese BBQ,"Plaza Faber, Jalan Desa Jaya, Taman Desa, Kuala Lumpur,

Their menu is dominated by different cuts of meat and meat platters for grilling purposes. The ingredients for yakiniku seem to be just beef and vegetables, as we hardly saw any other meat like pork, chicken, lamb and seafood. Suffice to say, if you don’t take beef, your choices here are severely limited.
First timers are recommended to try the chef’s daily selection of Special 4 Cuts, offered in normal and premium range at different weightage. The more elaborate platters are served on a mini bridge and even a wooden boat! Those cost between RM180 and RM700 though.",SHIN NIHON 新日本焼肉党,"26, Jalan 24/70A, Desa Sri Hartamas, KL

Akashi BBQ, Puchong","Akashi BBQ is the branch of Taishu Yakiniku with a different name – that alone says a lot about this Japanese BBQ joint. Our favorite (for pork) has got to be the Shoulder Loin @ RM10 for its perfect balance of meat and fat.
The Genghiskhan is a must try here. For RM20, you get a good amount of lamb shoulder nicely marinated, flavorful without any unpleasant “gamey” taste when cooked. Even the soup used to boil the vege at the side is tasty as hell. If you can’t get enough of it (very likely), you can request for additional lamb shoulder at RM15/portion.",Akashi BBQ – by Taishu Yakiniku,"Jalan Layang-Layang 1, 47100 Puchong

Steamboat Restaurants to Eat in KL & Klang ValleySteamboat Restaurants to Eat in KL & Klang Valley,"By - -June 14, 2017June 14, 2017
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","Safe to say steamboat, or hot pot is more popular in Klang Valley than any other places in Malaysia. There’s simply something special about this cook-it-yourself experience that keeps us coming back for more.
Maybe it’s because you don’t actually need to have an expensive 8-course Chinese dinner to get together for a meal with family and friends. Or maybe you just enjoy swishing thinly sliced meats and dip them into your favorite sauces.
Then there are plenty of soup choices that make every steamboat meal different. If the weather is chilly, go for tom yum or ‘ma lat’ soup. If you need something nourishing or to boost your energy, opt for the herbal ones. Even after you have tried it all, milky pork bone soup will always be a great choice to fall back on.
Here is a compilation of my tried and tested ones for you to explore. The list includes a la carte, buffet, Japanese shabu shabu, Hong Kong style and Taiwanese restaurants – basically any place that lets you cook something in a pot of boiling soup.

Top 20 ‘Must-Eat’ Places While In Ipoh – Best of Ipoh FoodTop 20 ‘Must-Eat’ Places While In Ipoh – Best of Ipoh Food,"By - -October 24, 2016October 24, 2016
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","Do you know that Lonely Planet recently listed Ipoh as one of the best Asian destinations to visit in 2016? It’s high time that Ipoh finally gets the recognition it truly deserves. Eating is probably the best activity to do in the city – and boy there are plenty of Ipoh food to eat.
Bean sprout chicken rice, ‘kai see hor fun’, egg tarts, white coffee, hakka mee, curry mee, ABC, caramel custard, yong tau fu and the list goes on.
If you are visiting Ipoh for a ‘makan trip’ soon, I hope you are going with an empty stomach. Here’s a list of Ipoh food consisting 20 must-try food stalls, coffee shops and restaurants to get you started.",HONG KEE CONFECTIONERY 鸿记饼家,"Address: Kedai Kopi Weng Seng, Jalan Dato Onn Jaafar, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: 7am – 2pm, closed on Fridays. Tel: 017-592 8303
Hong Kee makes one of the best egg tarts in town – known for having a crust with 48 crispy layers. It’s a family run business and they get up as early as 3am to bake their pastries and cakes which are delivered fresh to their stall in Weng Seng coffee shop.
Despite the immense popularity they enjoy, they remain down to earth and friendly towards their loyal customers who have supported them throughout these 40 years. So it’s no wonder they are able to sell more than 1000 pieces/day of egg tarts during weekends and public holidays.
Other specialties to try: Swiss Roll and Sachima (萨其马). Come as early as possible to avoid disappointments.",FOOK KEE FRIED NOODLES 福记炒粉,"Address: Restoran Yu Yee, Lebuh 3, Kg Simee, 31400 Ipoh
Business hours: 1pm – 5.30pm, closed on Sundays. Tel: 016-546 1671
Kampung Simee is a Chinese village dotted with eateries and bakeries. Fook Kee is a hidden gem specializing in fried noodles cooked with prawn stock.
Waiting time could reach 45 minutes or more during peak hours (frequented by locals) so my suggestion is to place your order, then wander off to the nearby bakeries to shop for biscuits or enjoy a bowl of ABC at Fei Ma’s stall first. By the time you return, your fried noodles should be ready within minutes.",RESTORAN NASI KANDAR AYAM MERAH (NASI GANJA),"Address: Yong Suan Coffee Shop, 2, Jalan Yang Kalsom, 30250 Ipoh
Business hours: 9.30am – 6pm. Tel: 05-254 4314
Also known as ‘nasi ganja’ due to its addictiveness, the nasi kandar stall operating from Yong Suan coffee shop is inarguably the most popular in Ipoh. Don’t be put off by the long queue of customers, as they are only taking away.
For those who are planning to eat in, proceed to take a seat and you can order from the friendly waiters directly. Just tell them what dishes you fancy – either served separately or on your rice flooded with a mix of curry gravies. I prefer the latter.
To give you an idea of their reasonable pricing, it’s RM16 for a plate with ayam goreng merah, fish curry, squid curry, salted egg, okra and a dollop of their signature mint chutney.",MING COURT HONG KONG TIM SUM 明阁香港点心,"Address: 32, 34, 36, Jalan Leong Sin Nam, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: 6am till finish. Tel: 05-255 7134
When it comes to dim sum, Ming Court is the prime choice for anyone who is Ipoh-mali. Recommended to reach before 7am to avoid the crowd for a more relaxed breakfast experience.",XIN QUAN FANG CURRY MEE 新泉芳咖喱面茶餐室,"Address: 174, Jalan Sultan Iskandar (Hugh Low Street), 30000 Ipoh
Business hours: 7.30am till finish (1pm). Tel: 016-531 4193
Xin Quan Fang, fondly known as ‘ma ta liu curry mee’ to locals churns out some of the best Hainanese curry mee and bean sprouts in town. Get all the side dishes which include a combination of roast pork, prawns, char siew, stewed pork served in a separate bowl. They tend to sell out earlier than the official closing time, so morning is the best time to drop by.",FUNNY MOUNTAIN SOYA BEAN 奇峰豆腐花,"Address: 49, Jalan Theatre, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: 10.30am – 6pm, closed on Tuesdays. Tel: 012-516 1607
Funny Mountain’s tau fu fah and soya bean milk enjoy a legendary status in Ipoh. A first timer’s trip to Ipoh would have been vain without trying the silky smooth and refreshing tau fu fah, guaranteed to redefine your view of this ubiquitous dessert.",CHOONG KEE BIG TREE YONG TAU FU 忠记大树头炸料粉,"Address: 1277 Jalan King, Taman Hoover, 31650 Ipoh
Business hours: 8.30am – 5.30pm, closed on Wednesdays
Also known as ‘Dai Shu Keok’ yong tau fu, Choong Kee operates like a mini factory constantly churning out freshly fried items which you can enjoy with koay teow soup or asam laksa. Fried turnip is a must-try here, as you can’t find it easily at other yong tau fu stalls outside Ipoh.",THEAN CHUN COFFEE SHOP 天津茶室,"Address: 73, Jalan Bandar Timah, 30000 Ipoh
Business hours: 8am – 4pm, closed on Thursdays
‘Halls of Mirros’ is another name for Thean Chun – coined after the large mirrors hanging on the coffee shop’s wall. Their staple offerings you shouldn’t miss include caramel custard, chee cheong fun, ‘kai see hor fun’ and pork satay – the last being a rare sight in Ipoh nowadays.",TONG SUI KAI 糖水街,"Address: Jalan Sultan Ekram, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: 5.30pm – 1am (varies for each stall)
One of the most happening eating places in Ipoh after the sun sets. ‘Tong Sui Kai‘ is lined with dozens of food stalls mostly selling desserts (hence the name), snacks like rojak, boiled cockles and various noodles.
Every stall has their own unique rendition and presentation of Ipoh’s famed mixed fruits ABC, so there’s always a reason to revisit this bustling street.",FAMOUS HAKKA MEE 客家面,"Address: Paris Coffee Shop, 164, Jalan Sultan Iskandar (Hugh Low Street), 30000 Ipoh
Business hours: 7.30am – 12pm
Besides minced meat, yong tau fu is also served in the Hakka Mee here – almost like a combo meal. One particular yong tau fu that stood out was the fried meat balls that have a hint of salted fish. Their homemade chilli sauce is delicious as well and improves the overall taste of the noodle.",LOKE WOOI KEE COFFEE SHOP 乐会居茶室,"Address: No 28, Jalan Mustapha Al-Bakri, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: 7am – 3pm
‘Hor Hee‘ is a Teochew noodle soup served with a mix of fish cakes, fish balls and fish dumplings. A dash of fried onion oil is added to the thick and flavorful soup to give it extra fragrance and aroma. It is a fast disappearing food in Ipoh – so you need to try it before it’s gone.
Loke Woi Kee coffee shop is your best (and most convenient) bet to enjoy this noodle. Even if you are not interested in having Hor Hee, the fruit rojak and ‘kai see sha hor fun’ here are delicious enough to make your visit worthwhile.",TAI SOO IPOH FAMOUS NO.1 DESSERT,"Address: 24, Jalan Raja Musa Aziz, 30000 Ipoh
Business hours: 10.30am – 6pm, usually closed on Wednesdays
A perfect spot for tea break, Tai Soo is famous for a couple of things: Ais Kacang (ABC), tau fu fah (melt in your mouth soft) and soya bean milk.
Their tau fu fah can be ordered with different toppings like cendol, glass jelly and red beans. It is also recommended that you buy a bottle or two of their soya bean milk to bring home – it’s rich and absolutely delicious.",IPOH STADIUM FOOD COURT (MEDAN SELERA STADIUM),"Address: Kompleks Sukan Ipoh, 31400 Ipoh
Business hours: 6pm – midnight
After most of the coffee shops in town have closed, locals throng this food court adjacent to the stadium for dinner and supper.
Traditional Ipoh-style wan ton mee and smoky char koay teow are clearly the favorites here, as you can see them present on almost every table.
For drinks, try out the refreshing herbal drink (next to wan ton mee stal) and freshly blended fruit juices from Frankie’s stall on the far right.",ONN KEE / LOU WONG BEAN SPROUT CHICKEN,"Address: Lou Wong 老黄芽菜鸡沙河粉 / Onn Kee 安记芽菜鸡沙河粉, Jalan Yau Tet Shin
Business hours: lunch and dinner till late
Probably what Ipoh is most famous for, beansprout chicken (nga choy kai) is commonly available – enjoyed either with rice or flat noodle. Side dishes are usually pork meat balls and stewed chicken feet. Onn Kee and Lou Wong are two of the oldest shops and both enjoy the same reputation for serving deliciously tender poached chicken.
My suggestion? Try both by ordering a quarter chicken at each restaurant to decide which suits your taste the best. But no matter which you end up eating at, it’s quite impossible for the meal to go wrong. Best of all, you can count both of them to be open for most of the time.",COWAN STREET AYAM TAUGE & KOITIAU 高温街芽菜鸡沙河粉,"Address: 44, Jalan Raja Ekram, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: Wed – Sun (7pm onwards). Tel: 012 5203 322 (Ah Meng)
If Lou Wong and Onn Kee are the to-go places for beansprout chicken rice, then Cowan Street’s Ayam Tauge & Koitiau would be the top choice for beansprout chicken hor fun.
Ordering is quick and simple. Just tell the number of portions and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the side dishes such as the gizzards and chicken feet (highly recommended) when asked. The poached chicken here is out-of-this-world tender and even the lean breast meat is nice and juicy.",DEEN CT CORNER CENDOL,"Address: 21B, Jalan Mustapha Al Bakri, 30300 Ipoh
Business hours: 11.30am – 6.30pm, closed on Fridays. Tel: 016-535 0351
Located just a stone’s throw away from Loke Wooi Kee and Tai Soo, Deen CT Corner serves an amazing bowl of cendol with the right balance of flavors.
Being able to customize your cendol is a plus here, as you can have it with any toppings of your choice – such as red beans only, or red beans with sweet corn. For a more filling experience, opt for the ‘pulut’ version which adds a spoonful of glutinous rice to keep you satiated longer.",NAM HEONG / NAM CHAU / SUN YUAN FOONG,"Address: Nam Heong 南香 – 2, Jalan Bandar Timah / Nam Chau 南州 – 54, Jalan Bandar Timah / Sun Yuan Foong 新源丰 – 17, Jalan Bandar Timah
Business hours: 6am – 5pm
Fancy a cup of white coffee? Your options are endless in Ipoh. To maximize your time, drop by Jalan Bandar Timah where you will find a couple of coffee shops each serving up their own unique blend of white coffee brewed to perfection. Nam Heong, Nam Chau and Sun Yuan Foong are located within walking distance from each other and all of them are great in their own ways.
But if you only have limited time or stomach space, decision should be based on the food you want to eat. If you are hankering for egg tarts, go to Nam Heong. For toasts, you won’t go wrong at Sun Yuan Foong while Nam Chau is great for noodles like dry curry mee.",FEI MA MIXED FRUITS ABC 肥妈雪水档,"Address: 224, Lebuh Raya 3, Kg Simee, Ipoh
Business hours: 1pm – 5pm, closed on Tuedays and Fridays
Fei Ma’s dessert stall is another hidden gem in Kampung Simee. If you had to leave Ipoh by evening which means you don’t get to eat at Tong Sui Kai, then this is the place to be since it’s open from lunch onward.
After compacting the shaved ice into shape by hand, Fei Ma starts garnishing each bowl with fruits (fresh, pickled and canned), a myriad of syrups, cendol, peanuts and jelly followed by a bath of sugar water.
Looking at the generous amount of fruits and tedious work that go into a bowl like this, it’s hard to believe that it costs only RM4.80. The moment you take a sip of the melted ice, you will know it’s truly something special. The combination of flavors from plum, lime and lemon makes this a refreshing treat that you can enjoy guilt-free.",KAFE YOON WAH 元华饮食阁雪花啤酒,"Address: 7, Jalan Bijih Timah, 30000 Ipoh
Business hours: 6pm till midnight. Tel: 012-512 9980
If you are looking for a place to enjoy a (grown up) drink like the locals do, then head to Kafe Yoon Wah for snow beer. Notice the slushie-like content in the mug? Those are actually foam that becomes crystallized when come into contact with a frozen glass.
Yoon Wah is also an ideal place for dinner and they serve a good range of Chinese seafood and meat dishes to go along with the drinks.",THE DECK GASTRO BAR / YUK SOU HIN 玉寿轩,"Address: WEIL Hotel, 292, Jalan Sultan Idris Shah, 30000 Ipoh
Business hours: The Deck Gastro Bar (5pm – 12am) / Yuk Sou Hin – Mon – Fri (10.30am – 2.30pm, 6pm – 10.30pm), Weekends (8am – 2.30pm, 6pm – 10.30pm)
Ipoh is not all about street food. Some of the most exquisite Chinese and Western dishes I ever had were at WEIL Hotel. Yuk Sou Hin is popular for their signature Smoked Duck with Lychee Wood and dim sum, while The Deck Gastro Bar is a rooftop bar to enjoy great food and cocktails with an awesome night view the city. Not to mention, live band too.",Leave a comment:,TAGS,SHARESHAREFacebookTwitterTwitter,"Previous articleNext articleNext article

There are dozens of places where you can get Penang Curry Mee in Klang Valley, but here are ten places to start looking for it.

"Seafood Tabur Buffet @ Talaykrata Seafood BBQ, PublikaSeafood Tabur Buffet @ Talaykrata Seafood BBQ, Publika","By - -May 2, 2019May 2, 2019
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","Besides being the first restaurant in KL to provide live tiger prawns to customers to catch and barbecue directly, Talaykrata Seafood BBQ is now also the first to offer seafood tabur buffet. If you don’t know what “seafood tabur” is, it’s just a localized version of Louisiana seafood boil. Watch how it’s served in the video here.
For RM68, you get to choose your seafood tabur in two sauces: Sambal Pedas or Buttermilk. You are given two hours to enjoy the meal which also includes free flow of Haagen Dazs ice cream, soft drinks and rice. With all things considered, this buffet is of good value and I highly recommend it.
The Sambal Pedas sauce is our favorite, as it’s truly spicy (but not punishingly hot) and appetizing. It just pairs well with the seafood and makes it irresistible not to eat with rice.
Buttermilk wise, it’s more suited for those who can’t handle spicy food. The sauce is rich and creamy and slightly sweet. The selection of seafood you get include tiger prawn, flower crab, mussel, lala and scallop. Sometimes there are squid or razor clams too, depending on the stock they have.
If you have been to Talaykrata Seafood BBQ before, you would know that the owners are very particular about the quality of seafood. One of the reasons is that they are from Sabah, where fresh seafood is in abundance. So they aim to provide a fresh and delicious experience to their customers as well.
After 3 months, there are some changes to their seafood BBQ’s starting set. Some items such as baby lobster, oysters and scallops with cheese mayo have been replaced with mud crab with roe and pen shell – a type of giant clam. Other popular items like giant fresh water prawn and giant scallop are still included in the set.
And of course, live tiger prawns are still being replenished frequently. This is one of the best things of eating here as compared to other places which also offer live prawns. As soon as the customers have finished catching he prawns from the ‘river’, the restaurant would refill them immediately.
So don’t worry about the restaurant being stingy about the live tiger prawns. Don’t need to be kiasu and just focus on enjoying the meal at your own pace.
The easiest way to look for this restaurant is by locating Papparich or Bestari Nasi Kandar in Publika. Talaykrata Seafood BBQ is located at the same row, but further down the shop lots towards Jalan Duta side.

"Kuro Japanese Steamboat Buffet @ Plaza Arkadia, Desa Park CityKuro Japanese Steamboat Buffet @ Plaza Arkadia, Desa Park City","By - -June 17, 2019June 17, 2019
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","One of the best things about living in Kepong is that you will never need to travel out of town for steamboat. A steamboat restaurant can be found at every corner of this town and dozens of them can be found at Bandar Menjalara alone.
However, almost every one of them is Chinese hot pot styled so if you wanted something different like shabu shabu, your choices are extremely limited.
Luckily, Kuro Japanese Steamboat opened at Plaza Arkadia not long ago and it’s only a quick 10 minutes drive away. Price wise it’s alright because it’s a buffet which includes free flow of Haagen-Dazs ice cream.
The normal buffet package starts at RM54.90 for lunch and RM64.90 for dinner. For a more indulgent experience, you can opt for their Wagyu buffet – either RM128 for Australian Wagyu or RM338 for Japanese Wagyu. Currently, they are also having a promotion for the latter where the 2nd diner enjoys a 50% off the bill.
There are 6 types of soup available and you can pick any two of them. They are Kuro Broth (pork bone soup), Spicy Kuro Broth, Shabu-Shabu, Sukiyaki, Japanese Curry and Mala. During our visit, we picked their signature Kuro Broth and Sukiyaki – essentially one savory and the other being sweet to contrast the flavors.
Meat wise there are Kurobuta pork, Australian beef, Australian lamb, chicken, squid, dory fish slices and homemade seafood paste. Since we opted for the Japanese Wagyu buffet, all these meats and seafood are also included in the package. Here’s what you could expect for the same:
Japanese Wagyu – grade A5 and the marbling as you can see is excellent. They take only seconds to cook in the broth and tastes absolutely tender and wonderful, they just melt in your mouth.
Australian Wagyu – the marbling is not as intense but still highly enjoyable. If you are the kind of person who likes to have a little chew in your meat, I think you would prefer this to the Japanese version.
Kurobuta Pork Belly
Kurobuta Pork Shoulder
Kurobuta Pork Loin
Australian Beef Belly
Australian Beef Shoulder
Australian Lamb
Squid and Dory Fish – we have never been a fan of dory so this was probably the only item we did not refill.
Homemade paste – it tastes like a cross of fish and squid paste with a really nice texture. Highly recommended to try.
If for some reason you are bored of the premium meats, head to the common buffet spread with more than 30 kinds of meat balls, vegetables and noodles. Based on what we sampled, our favorites are the Ika ball, curry fish ball and mushroom ball.
There are plenty of sauces and condiments present too which lets you customize your very own dipping sauce. We didn’t experiment too much on this, since we found that a simple combination of soy sauce and chili garlic paste is good enough to pair with anything.
Haagen-Dazs ice cream is without a doubt a highlight of the buffet. There are multiple flavors to try and they all taste just so good. So it’s not surprising to see the customers actually attacking the ice cream first before they start enjoying their steamboat.
All in all, if you are looking for a good Japanese steamboat try, Kuro will not disappoint. The normal buffet is already good enough and worth the price you are paying for.
As for the Wagyu promo, you really gotta be able to eat a lot of it to make it worthwhile. The price might be a little high but definitely worth checking out if you just want to enjoy as much Japanese Wagyu as possible for a fixed price.

Ramadan Menu Offerings @ Mcdonald’s MalaysiaRamadan Menu Offerings @ Mcdonald’s Malaysia,"By - -May 20, 2019May 20, 2019
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","Throughout the month of Ramadan, McDonald’s Malaysia has launched two new menu offerings for its guests. If you are looking for a delicious, fulfilling meal to break fast (even at wee hours) during the month of Ramadan, this should interest you.
The two new exclusive offerings that customers can choose are – the all new Nasi McD and the Chicken Foldover which has returned.
The new Nasi McD is paired with spicy Ayam Goreng McD and served with an all new Curry Sauce that customers can add-on for a kuah banjir experience. The Chicken Foldover has a new spicy sauce and it’s still served with two pieces of grilled chicken patties, topped with fresh lettuce and tomatoes, wrapped in a warm toasted flatbread.
The Ramadan menu is sold throughout the month of Ramadan until 5 June 2019. The Sahur meal, which started on 6 May, saw McDonald’s extending selected Regular Menu items until 6am to cater to customers who are fasting. The Sahur menu includes the Nasi McD, Ayam Goreng McD, McChicken, Spicy Chicken McDeluxe, and Chicken McNuggets, which will be available to customers looking for a satisfying meal to bersahur with at McDonald’s.
Besides the two new menu mentioned above, you can also look forward to a range of desserts with Malaysians’ favorite flavors. McDonald’s is not only bringing back the D24 Durian McFlurry, they are also reintroducing the Banana Pie, with its aromatic banana filling in crisp pillow pie. It’s just the perfect item to break fast with.
For those who are always on the go, McDonald’s dessert menu line-up also includes the Sarsaparilla Cones and the new McCafe Ice Blended Ribena. The latter is also blended with strawberry sauce for a burst of fruity flavor. These will serve as sweet and refreshing ending to a satisfying meal.
If you haven’t downloaded the McDonald’s App, now there’s a good reason to do so. McDonald’s has also launched the “30-Days of Ramadan” promotion which is only available exclusively via the App.
The ’30-days, 30 deals’ offers special discount coupons that will be released on the App on a daily basis. Customers simply need to download the McDonald’s App from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store to enjoy these amazing discounts.",Leave a comment:,SHARESHAREFacebookTwitterTwitter,"Previous articleNext articleNext article

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""","Namelaka Patisserie, Bangsar","Forget the pre cny detox- we always have the appetite for a good dessert, especially ones befitting the season. Namelaka Patisserie is the perfect pick for sweets to kickstart a year of indulgence.  Hidden away on the first floor in Telawi Bangsar, it is easy to missed the staircase leading to a bright and spacious room filled with calm and comfort. Look for the KK mart and the stairways will lead you to the simplicity of natural sweetness that wins my heart.
There is no shortcrust pasty or sweet filling and rich chocolate topping whatsoever, only the finest technique with the most creative input of inspiration gathered from both beauty and imperfection of real fruit. With lots of white chocolate, and celebrating mother nature’s creation of some of the tastiest fruits, Namelaka Patisserie created unique dessert taking form of real fruit accordingly to the flavor of each respective fruits, without even having to plate it to impress their customers. The brilliant twists lie in the form of the dessert molded in 3d and a ganache layer of fresh smooth fillings holding chunks of real fruits encased at the core of each dessert fruit, as this creamy filling hold the shape of the dessert. It will be a real challenge trying to pack this because from what I see, it is best consume in the house. And why not? Since the interior provide nothing but comfy and relaxing as well as sleek clean of immaculate white.
Attention to detail abounds. Passionfruit and pear have the most beautiful exterior and is aesthetically the prettiest if you badly need to feed your camera. Myself is so in love with the sleek green apple but while the names sounded like a breeze, it’s a dish best left to the professionals.
It’s not a cake and it looks almost too pretty to eat, but this fruit dessert is totally extraordinary not only in essence, it comprises real fruit, and when break open, creating an otherworldly confection that simple begs to be photographed.
Don’t forget to enjoy with their cocktail or coffee brew. I find myself drawn to their mocktail mainly thanks to the freshness of mint infused and the frizzy.
Namake is a very new establishment during my visit and more dessert would soon to come. It is not usual that I speak so highly on dessert places but I am liking no artificial sugar added so I am looking forward to what they have next.

Macao does casinos and entertainment like no other city. The glam and bling of luminescence and iridescent glow at every single corner reflects the class and hospitality Macao has come to represent. At MGM, the lustrous warren of comfy nooks for wooing, with an elegant even though not as imposing bar to sit at if you like some bartender chat with your drinks- there’s history and storytelling for the tasting notes on what’s offered behind the bar, which might not arouse much interest in wine or beer drinker, but is quite handy for whisky or gin lover.
Serving their signature Portuguese inspired cocktail tonight, the folks behind the bar are all practiced professionals; personable, knowledgeable and looking sharp and handsome in nicely pressed suits. Our mixologist told us quite an interesting story from how Patua Penicillin (MOP 95) came about and how dark rum, scotch, and infusion of lemon, ginger, fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme and dill works their magic as it sits longer before pouring into your drinking glasses. Also serving us a couple of other well- executed drinks like the Bunny Mary (MOP 95), the energy is high in this handsome room filled with sets of modern European.
 





consisting of dark rum, scotch, lemon, ginger, honey syrup, fresh herbs
For those in need of some food, the tapas do the trick. Key to good tapas in my opinion, is all in the combination of skillful cooking and the most convivial of atmospheres if not the sourcing of the finest ingredients; in which Bar Patua absolutely fulfills. They might not strike sourcing of perfect ingredients and very little attention to details when it comes to presentation but combined with the pairing of ethanol compound, it is all good to most people.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""",Legit burger joint at Jalan Imbi- Burger on 16,Leave a reply,"Burger On 16 at Jalan Imbi
#sycookiesxburger #foodeverywhere
Burger on 16 pride themselves on using the best meat. The burgers are uproariously good, but so is the atmosphere at this fun food joint. Service is smiley and personal, and the thoughtful availability of power sockets and wifi connection to digital nomads as well as visiting tourists or neighborhood hostel residences. In a city where anyone with access to buns and patties proclaims they’re the best, it takes something unique and innovative to stand out from the crowd. In the case of Burger on 16, the difference is the incorporation of crowd favourite- cheese. The burgers here are quite some good ones around Klang Valley- some with cheese inside the patty and on the patty, another with pesto sauce, but what gives this operation its appeal is the value for money and an extra dollop of fun.
Crowd pleaser California Cheese Skirt (RM 25.90) and Mad Cheese 200g (RM 24.90) are humming with flavour and far more complex in creation than they’re ever given credit for. Beef Patty topped with cheese skirt, or stuffed with cheddar cheese, with tomato, jalapeno caramelized onion, sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce and sauce. There is not much space for anything beyond the cheese skirt. This cheese skirt is ever compromising my burger grip but come on, it’s cheese we are talking about. If you prefer white meat alternative in your burger, there is one with grilled chicken breast topped with caramelized onion, tomato salsa, cheddar cheese, lettuce and basil pesto sauce. This Chicken Phenomena (RM 17.90) maybe a little dry compared to their beef patties despite smothered in those delicious and rich pesto sauce, but eat it while its hot. You’ll enjoy it as much.
Chicken Phenomena (RM 17.90)
Mad Cheese 200g (RM 24.90)
California Cheese Skirt (RM 25.90), and look at the size of this half burger
And you don’t need to know how burgers are grilled, or where they are imported from. All burger joints tell you the same. You just need to know that if you’re going to be eating burgers, and munching on sides like Cowboy Fries (Beef/ Chicken) RM 13.50 and Buffalo Wings (RM 14.90), both of which is a little salty to me but I maybe the only being picky over my food. Folks within the proximity is lucky to have this burger joint grilling 7 days a week.
Cowboy Fries (Beef/ Chicken) RM 13.50
Buffalo Wings RM 14.90
And don’t forget to wash it all down with of milk shake or smoothies because Nutella chocolate milk shake is da bomb! But of course, when da bomb is too much to take in, check out their coffee. They’ve invested quite a bit at the coffee machine yet they are decently priced at less than RM 10 for a cup of latte.

Mango smoothie RM 12.90, Nutella Chocolate milk shake RM 12.90, Latte RM 9.90, Ice Lemon Tea RM 7.50

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""","Must Have Macao Sweet Treats! Portuguese tart, which is the best?",Leave a reply,"Macao Sweet Treats! Portuguese tart, which is the best?
#sycookiestravelogue, #foodeverywhere #2018macaoyearofgastronomy #experiencemacao #sycookiesxmacao
Macau egg tarts. They aren’t exactly quite “news” anymore but a visit to Macao must have egg tarts on the itinerary. Macau egg tarts were initially and commonly considered a Portuguese import, with Lord Stow being one of the early names for egg when it comes to Macao Portuguese tart. Today, it is probably most iconic version of sweet treat in Macao. The recent trip to Macao with the Macao Tourism Malaysia got me learning so much more about this little sweet treat.
Why egg tart and not custard tart? I read somewhere it was due to lacking a direct translation for “custard” into Chinese, hence according to the couple who contributed most to this signature sweet treat of Macao, they just called them egg tarts from when they first started the business at Lord Stow’s first bakery. Chinese customers then, needing a way to distinguish them from the British-style custard tarts, the ones with a short crust (still made in Hong Kong), started calling them ‘Portuguese’ egg tarts, creating a confusing taxonomy that persists to this day.
After their separation, both Lord Stow’s and Margarete’s still bakes to locals and tourist on a daily basis. To say or declare either one as the best egg tart wouldn’t do either party any justice. After all, taste profiles are subjective and if any of the answer is as important, I would say let’s look at the years of dedication and what both has contributed to the growth of tourism Macao. With the birth of this pastry treat, and the effort put into continuing the legacy, it is safe to say that Portuguese Egg Tart is synonymous with one of what defines Macao (or at least, the tourism of Macao).
Photography is not allowed but I had a gentle nod when asked if I can shoot. Thanks for being so accommodative.
Lord Stow’s Original Shop
The Crazy line outside Margaret’s Cafe e Nata
Modern version of Portuguese tart may present themselves in assortment of flavours but one that is most epic has got to be this one, unnecessarily with bird nest on it. 壹燕糖甜品 (Yī yàn táng tiánpǐn ) does egg tart with a dollop of bird nest on it. This solidified saliva and are particularly prized in specifically the Chinese culture due to the rarity and supposedly nutritional value. The texture is almost insignificant, let alone the flavour profile. Had this during out Food Hunt organised by the MGTO (Malaysia) .
A trip to Macau is not complete without having some egg tarts, I highly recommend the original tart and that you try them both and decide which one you like best. But before planning on that, you might want to take note that KFC’s egg tart had their recipe from Margarete herself! That’s right… go google that up! If you’ve tried the KFC’s egg tart, then you might have already tried Margarete’s recipe.
If anyone is keen to bake your own egg tart in Macao, Le Cesar is where you can sign up for your Portuguese tart workshop. I baked my first Macao Portuguese egg tart here too! Read about it here: https://wp.me/p1tyh7-2d7

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""","Margaret’s Café e Nata Macao, Authentic Portuguese Egg Tart","Margaret’s Café e Nata Macao. Are they any good or better than Lord Stow’s ? Who wins the battle of Macao Portuguese Egg Tart?
Macau egg tarts were initially and commonly considered a Portuguese import, with Lord Stow being one of the early names for egg when it comes to Macao Portuguese tart. Another famous egg tart seller, often linked in many posts as battle and showdown of both recipes as to who bakes the best Portuguese tart, is at the Margaret’s Cafe. Both Margaret and Stow are friendly competitors. Once married, the two used to operate Lord Stow’s Bakery. It is no surprise she will forever be Lord Stows ex wife whenever anyone go into intensive egg tart debate. This in my opinion doesn’t do Margaret much justice. Margaret’s Café e Nata should be best known for her own effort when it comes to Portuguese egg tart instead of her love life.
I personally enjoy Margaret’s because the brulee on Lord Stows were simply too overwhelming for my liking. The line though… That I did not enjoy. Fortunately, it was fast moving and having a good company to queue can be a good idea, except that would also make the line seemed endlessly long, which isn’t too great for everyone else. Oh well… I am sometimes selfish and I admit it. LOL!
Freshly baked at a very quick pace and flaky buttery delicious with a good ratio of custard and light crispy brulee on top, is a must when visiting Macao. There is always a queue and it is all part of the experience when travelling to Macao. This month is exceptionally gorgeous with light breeze and slight cooling temperature- best to stroll around and chill with these freshly baked bites of delicious sweet treats.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""","Kara – Conceptual French Cuisine, Kota Damansara (Sunway Giza Mall)",Leave a reply,"This contemporary French joint is all set with autumn-hued dining room and that neat and immaculate table arrangements. Lighting that creates a warm and intimate vibe that will heat up the heart before the stomach warms up for the main course, with a free flow of salad and appetizers at the salad bar. Indulge in Kara’s lunch offerings, including starter soda, one main of the day, and a spread of free flow salad and appetizers.
Beautifully served in champagne flutes, the Elderberry and Elderflower mix of soda cordials.
This salad bar is most lauded with bruschetta and slaws, and most delicious selection of cheese and olive. The hype surrounding its launch wasn’t prominent, but this polished tribute to the ultimate French contemporary is still charged with dynamite je ne sais quoi from affordable lunch serving through to romantic dinner. There is an entire service team making sure this contemporary restaurant living up to its reputation in both exceptional customer attention and culinary innovation. We are talking about set lunch buffet of RM 25+ and that is an absolute steal when it comes to value for money French cuisine.
Kara has tinkered little with the nostalgic transatlantic dishes, and we enjoyed the salad bar. But the pasta main course that followed was over-cooked: though well executed and teamed with a light pasta sauce, and cubes of salmon chunks seemed a match. Much better was the beef and chicken ratatouille, served in the portion perfect for lunch. Gravy for beef might be a little heavy but to have that with the bread is amazing. The tender beef helps balance it all but it needs more herbs. Some tweaks could be good but the portions are generous and price tags are small, it is worth every cent for quality like this, in particularly in relation to the ace ingredients and supremely innovative flavours.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""",Lei Ka Choi Hot Pot at Broadway Macao’s Hot Pot sensation,Leave a reply,"#sycookiestravelogue, #foodeverywhere #2018macaoyearofgastronomy #experiencemacao #sycookiesxmacao
Hot pot is the quintessential food especially when the season turns colder. My first night in Macao was cold and much pump with anxious to if I would enjoy my trip as much if it wasn’t a work assignment. The hot pot dinner instantly had all of us bonded in no time. The communal atmosphere of dunking vegetables into a big pot of boiling soup or broth and lingering over it together with the bunch is the recipe for a perfect evening, and the heat emitted from the boiling pot itself will keep even the coldest of hearts warm this fall in Macao.
Whatever type of hot pot that tickles your fancy, they are all here in Broadway’s Food Street. With more than 50 selections of sizzling and blister pops of boiling broth and soups, and whether fiery flavor or sweet umami, Broadway Macao’s Hot Pot Sensations , it is the time of the year to huddle up and cook away. Imagine the entire street filled with hot steams and aroma wafting through and this is currently happening now till 28th February 2019. Perfect weather this very moment and perfect timing if you are visiting during the lunar new year.
Prepared over a charcoal flame, the casserole packs the flavour and aroma with layers of taste profile harmoniously coming together in chunks and bites of very tender and delicious meat. Lei Ka Choi here is a Micheline recommended and it is not difficult to see why. Their success passes over generations as they innovatively raised the bar of traditional Cantonese claypot dishes. Serving the best of traditional Shunde cuisine, I am totally thrilled with the uniqueness of the dish when it is categorised as hot pot, and how the naked flavours with such subtle cooking skills are being translated into lip smacking. Together with bean curds, and the freshly cooked vegetables to your own liking of texture, it is part of Shunde culinary heritage to showcase the freshest and best of quality in the ingredients. With very little liquid, vegetables are cooked mostly with the high temperature so each bite of vegetables are still packed with flavours.
Simple fresh cuts of meat slowly cooked with turnip and pepper soup.
The menu includes a whole range of different fresh but can be hard to decipher for a beginner so just going for the abovementioned dishes is a safe bet. But skip the fried fish ball to save some quota for dessert next door despite it being a signature dish. Actually, skip all the side dishes if you are considering a drink or two at the nearby bars. Their hot pot is where the highlight is.

Gathering the famous names, Food Street could save you so much time travelling around Macao when all the latest and oldest are gathered along this street.That we are talking about names like San Ma Lo Seng Kei Congee, Chi Kei Ngao Chap, Yi Sun, as well as some popular names crossed over from Hong Kong, such as Tsui Wah or Tim Ho Wan. Topping that with vibrant entertainment and art performances at all time, dining is fully entertained and pleasant. Not to mention the availability of International and Macanese dining houses. It is the perfect place to taste Macao at one location. That is if you have the space in your stomach.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""",Infused with love at Hard Rock Café,Leave a reply,"Infused with love at Hard Rock Café with their limited-edition menu and enjoy freshly prepared American classic favourites at an outstanding world class services with glam of rock and roll. With fine ingredients to create the best of authentic American style food, Hard Rock is always a lively venue offering plenty to keep entertained throughout and after the meal. Vintage posters and iconic music with variety of cocktails only means that there’s always something to relate to whenever visiting any of their branches. I’ve personally went to both Hard Rock Kuala Lumpur and Hard Rock Melaka within this duration of the availability of their limited-edition featured menu.

Sizzling platters of Tequila and Lime Chicken Fajitas were impressive with chicken nicely cooked, lettuce freshly sliced, and very refreshing sour cream, avocado mashed, and cheese to accompany. The chicken marinated in tequila and lime, then grilled and seasoned with Tex Mex style spices, on a bed of grilled jalapenos and onions was delicious and generous when it comes to portion serving size.

Crispy Chicken Sliders was probably the stealer and if anyone knows me well, would know that I am not into battered meat but this one got me eating quite a lot of it; as a matter of fact, I reordered the same at my second visit- it was that good! Beer battered crispy chicken on three toasted slider buns with melted Monterey Jack Cheese and pickled, served with seasoned French fries is probably one of their best featured item and I love the choice of Monterey Jack to be melted in between the sliders. And like the rest of their food serving, this one was generous as well.
Go with a group of friend, have fun with their cocktail and mocktails but most importantly, don’t skip the chicken sliders.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""",Burgers and Lobsters @ Sky Avenue Genting Highland – Still a hype in 2019?,"Since their opening in the Sky Avenue Genting Highlands, Burger & Lobster has long been considered a gastronomic must for visitors so it was no surprise that it prompted massive queues consisting of both locals and tourists. Some would even make a day trip just to indulge in a meal of burger and lobster at in the chilly temperature of Genting Resorts. As straight forward as its name, the restaurant sells two items only. Menu is so simple it is either lobster in several cooking method or Burger for those loving thick beef patties in between buns. Gaining so much love from fans all over the world, this eatery’s global expansion has been nothing but a great success, especially when they feature a unique local flavour at each one of their outlets in different countries respectively. My first visit was when I tagged along for one of their bloggers engagement session but I wasn’t too impressed to be honest. Second visit was a casual hang out at Genting and it was equally unimpressive. The following visits were amusingly inconsistent with several dining session rather enjoyable while the rest of the time being rather disappointing.
Lobster served in intense thick chili that’s also in my opinion, uncharacteristically diminutive sweet, wasn’t really a thing for me especially when all it does was overshadowing any flavour from the lobster. Hence, it was a onetime experience only for me. Every other time was every other thing and this time, I had the best lobster roll out of the many other times of my visit here in Burger and Lobsters Malaysia. This time, I could taste amazing texture so juicy and bouncy, it was delectable.
Read my first visit HEREHERE
Skip the drinks at any cost but kudos to any gimmicky beverage. They are only good for picture taking.

"FOODEVERYWHEREA Malaysian food blog with tagline: ""Great food can come from anywhere""",Mong Seng Kopitiam for some authentic Hee Kiaw Noodle @ Melaka,"#sycookiesxmelaka
The coffee shop operates till late night, the only one lit along the street. On darker and colder nights, steams and lights from inside the shop and near the corridor at where a hawker cart is showcasing the Hee Kiaw is all that is visible from where parking is aplenty on the opposite road. The majority of items are less than RM 10 a bowl– you’ll get some spare change back when you order any of the noodle type, dry or soup, thick kuey tiao or yellow mee, bee hoon or even without the noodles if you choose to go with their tau kee alone instead. There is no hor fun noodles (I think), which is great because hor fun is only great and can only be fantastic as chicken hor fun. Sure, they are a lot chewier than kuey Tiaw, but it certainly isn’t going to replace kuey tiaw in certain dishes, especially in this case- it is going to be super clumpy put into dry hee kiaw noodle.
Unable to choose between yellow mee or kuey tiao, I went with mix of both. It’s an efficient operation, there’s no table service, customers order at the cooking station and the food comes to your table at lightning speed. A big bowl of noodle comes with basic fish cake slices, fish balls, and thick cut of smoky char siew. Sprinkled with fried shallots and topped with a generous dollop of chili sauce, with optional additional pieces of tau kee and assorted fish paste parcels, this shouldn’t be a supper portion at all. Take note the chili is a traditional sop for years so unless asked to opt out during when you order, you are getting the chili whether you like it or not. The chili though, was lovely if not great. Slightly briny from the shrimp or seafood alike ingredient that I believe was added onto it. Could be fish sauce, and while the saltiness isn’t to my liking, it’s hard to complain when you can get a decent meal for less than a tenner. Especially when the fish ball noodle and taukee pieces were so decently delicious.
Paid RM 5.70 for this!!

GoodyFoodies,"Food & Travel Blog by Baby Sumo - Restaurant and hotel reviews, recipes, and more.","Monday, October 11, 2021",Recipe: Bara Chirashi Don ばらちらし,"One of my favourite things to order and eat at the Japanese restaurant is bara chirashi don. It is an affordable yet delicious way to enjoy Japanese food. Bara chirashi don, is a Japanese rice bowl with chopped raw fish (usually a variety of fish - salmon, tuna, octopus, tobiko), vegetables (cucumber, pickles or avocado) and tamago (eggs). The raw fish is usually cubed and marinated with soy sauce and mirin.
At home, we make our own bara chirashi don using salmon only since this is the most accessible raw fish for us. Bara chirashi, for us, is best enjoyed with a hot bowl of miso soup and EXTRA sashimi. 




Bara chirashi ばらちらし
Recipe by Baby Sumo
Preparation time:15 minutes
Serves 4


Ingredients
300g sashimi grade salmon fillet, cubed
1 tbsp Japanese soy sauce
1/8 tsp wasabi
1 avocado, peeled and cubed
3 cups cooked Japanese short grain rice
1/2 Japanese cucumber, small cubes (optional)
50g tobiko or ikura (optional)



For the sushi rice vinegar
2 tbsp rice vinegar
1/2 tbsp caster sugar
1/2 tsp salt


For the thin omelette
2 eggs
1/2 tsp sugar
A pinch of salt
Cooking oil




1. Combine the rice vinegar, caster sugar and salt in a small bowl, until sugar and salt has dissolved. Pour the vinegar mixture over the rice and using a spatula, mix the rice and vinegar mixture. Cool the rice to room temperature. 


2. Next, cook the thin omelette. Beat the eggs with sugar and salt. Coat a frying pan with a thin layer of oil and heat over medium heat. Pour half the egg into the pan and swirl so eggs spread evenly to coat the base of the pan. Cook until eggs have set. Set aside to cool. Once cool, roll the omelette and thinly slice.


3. Mix soy sauce and wasabi in a bowl and then toss the sashimi cubes.

4. Divide rice into four bowls. Top with omelette, sashimi and avocado. Enjoy with hot miso soup and more sashimi!




Tip: You can also top the bara chirashi with toasted nori (seaweed). My son also enjoys making his own sushi / maki so it's good to have some nori seaweed on hand.

GoodyFoodies,"Food & Travel Blog by Baby Sumo - Restaurant and hotel reviews, recipes, and more.","Monday, October 4, 2021",Recipe: Char Kway Teow 炒粿條,"Char kway teow (CKT) 炒粿條 is one of my all-time favourite noodle dishes. It literally translates to fried flat rice noodles. This is one of my favourite places to get a delicious plate of CKT in Cheras but since the pandemic started, we have only been a couple of times in the past two years. Instead, I have been honing my CKT skills at home. Obviously, not as great as Aunty CKT's (cos no flame cooking at home to get the wok hei) but not too shabby for a homecooked version.
Our homecooked char kway teow comes with copious amounts of fishcake, beansprouts, chives and large prawns as well as egg, crispy pork lard and cili giling for spice. Here is my recipe if you'd like to try cooking it at home too!

GoodyFoodies,"Food & Travel Blog by Baby Sumo - Restaurant and hotel reviews, recipes, and more.","Monday, September 27, 2021",Recipe: Beef Keema (Indian Ground Beef Curry),"When I was searching for some different ways for cooking minced beef, I came across this recipe for beef keema. Beef keema is a dry Indian ground beef curry, most popular in North India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. 

For my version, I used a hot curry powder such as Madras as well as spices such as garam masala. Other than beef, you will also find chopped onions, ginger, garlic, potato, carrot and peas in this dry curry - making this a perfect one-pot meal! 




Beef Keema
Recipe by Baby Sumo, adapted from BBC Good Food
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 40 minutes
Serves 4

Ingredients
350g minced beef
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tsp grated ginger
1T cooking oil
2T hot curry powder, such as Madras
1 tsp garam masala
1 potato, cubed
1 carrot, cubed
1 cup frozen peas
500ml water or beef stock
1T tomato purée


Coriander, to garnish

1. Heat oil in pan over medium heat. Sauté onions, garlic and ginger for 4-5 mins, until onions are softened.
2. Brown beef, about 4-5 minutes.
3. Add curry powder, tomato purée, carrot, and potato and mix well. Add beef stock. Simmer for 15 mins, stirring occasionally.
4. Add peas and cook for further 10 mins. By now the stock should have been fully absorbed. Taste and season with salt if necessary.
5. Garnish with coriander and serve with rice.

*If using water, you will need to season with extra 1 tsp chicken stock granules / salt.

GoodyFoodies,"Food & Travel Blog by Baby Sumo - Restaurant and hotel reviews, recipes, and more.","Saturday, September 25, 2021",The Halal Integrity of Australian Beef and Lamb | Recipe for Sabah-Style Beef Soto,"Australia is an impeccable source of halal meat and meat products, being a long trusted supplier of Halal Beef and Lamb to over 100 countries, including the Middle East, Indonesia and Malaysia.


“Halal” is an Arabic word meaning lawful and permitted. It refers to not only adherence to a set of conditions on how the animal is slaughtered and meat processed but also to how the animal is treated while alive. According to Islamic law it must not be mistreated nor has any pain inflicted on it during its lifetime. It must also be provided with enough space to roam, clean water, food and fresh air. 


All these conditions are met for Halal beef and lamb production in Australia. The animals graze on lush green pastures and are well cared for. It is a natural way of life for livestock in Australia and animal welfare is regulated by laws enforced by government. These have a positive impact on the consistently high quality of Australian Halal beef and lamb. 








A recent study by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) has revealed that animals raised and processed in a stress-free environment produce better quality meat that are consistent, hygienic, safe and nutritious. These are the beneficial attributes that are permissible for consumption. 


Australian Halal beef and lamb are versatile and suitable for Asian and western cuisine, turning out delicious and nutritious dishes each time. With such quality, fresh and tender meat, it takes less time to cook, whether it’s a beef rendang or a spicy lamb stew. 


All cattle, sheep and goats processed in Australia for the Malaysia market are slaughtered under the Australian Government Supervised Halal Program by accredited Muslims. This program is administered by the Federal Department of Agriculture in Australia. 


Additionally, all processing facilities in Australia employ only registered and trained Muslim slaughtermen from the Halal Certifying Bodies. They also comply with personal hygiene, operational sanitation and animal welfare requirements. These Halal Certifying Bodies are recognised and approved by JAKIM (Department of Islamic Development of Malaysia). The Halal systems and production facilities are regularly audited by internal quality and food safety assurance systems, (Australian and importing country representatives from DVS (Department of Veterinary Services of Malaysia) and JAKIM. 


With a population of 16 million Muslims, Malaysia has a growing demand for halal meat and meat products. The meat is certified halal prior to its import into Malaysia. These authorised representatives will confirm the manufacturing process adheres to Halal standards. There are currently 7 Muslim certifying bodies in Australia for Halal certification export to Malaysia. Meat exporters will also need to meet other requirements under Australian regulations prior to export. Every shipment carries a Halal and Health Certificate. 


Malaysia stands to benefit from both local demand and strong export opportunities by leveraging increasing purchasing power among consumers in other Muslim markets. These include the Middle East and neighbouring Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim country with a population of more than 200 million. 


There are increasing opportunities in Malaysia’s Halal economy. As a member of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), Malaysia’s Halal certification is globally recognised by all Muslim nations, making it a perfect launch market for exporters. Meat and Livestock Australia recently took part in MIHAS (Malaysia International Halal Showcase), the world’s largest Halal exhibition. It’s a hybrid event from 9 to 12 September, combining virtual and physical exhibition, with halal industry players from around the world. The virtual exhibition will continue till 31 December 2021. 


Nearly 30,000 visitors, 28 trade envoys and 2,000 delegates representing the entire Halal supply chain attended MIHAS and the Global Halal Summit in 2019. 


According to Ms Valeska, Regional Manager for Southeast Asia of MLA, “Australian Halal beef and lamb work well with Asian and western cuisine, turning out delicious and nutritious dishes each time. With such quality, fresh and tender meat, it takes less time to cook, whether it’s a beef rendang or a spicy lamb stew”. 








MLA conducted a Webinar “Your Trusted Halal Australian Beef and Lamb, from Farm to Plate” this month. 


Below is a recipe shared by one of the speakers of the webinar, Chef Jason Manson.

Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Air Negara (SPAN) is teaming up with Shopee to encourage Malaysians to use water-efficient products through the Jimat Air 1.0 campaign, from now to 31 December 2021.

Malaysian households will be provided with a RM200 voucher when buying the selected water-efficient washing machines approved by SPAN through the e-commerce platform. There are more than 200 types of washing machines carrying the “Jimat 1.0” tag for ease of identification, to be featured in this campaign via a microsite.

The Jimat Air 1.0 microsite can be found in the Buy Malaysia in-app portal on the Shopee app homepage. Users can also reach the microsite by typing “Jimat Air” or “SPAN on Shopee” at the search bar.

Dato' Haji Ahmad Faizal bin Abdul Rahman, SPAN Chief Executive Officer said “Due to the increase of economic activities and population as well as urbanization, clean water has already become a scarce commodity in the country, therefore, it is important to educate the mindsets of Malaysians towards water conservation. I am hoping that each Malaysian can gradually reduce the amount of water that they consume daily through the awareness of programs such as the Jimat Air 1.0 campaign. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the country’s water consumption from the current 241 litre per capita per day, to 160 litre per capita per day by 2030.”

Kenneth Soh, Shopee Senior Manager (Marketing) said “Water plays an important role in our daily lives. Everyone has their responsibility in ensuring sufficient resources for years to come. Besides environmental conservation, consumers will not only obtain the savings from the vouchers, but they will eventually be benefitting from the reduction of their water bills. We thank SPAN for allowing us to be a part of this campaign which has a lasting impact not just on the lives of people but also the environment.”

For greater savings and a more rewarding experience, Malaysians can also look for deals during the e-commerce platform’s 10.10 Brands Festival which will take place from 20 September till 10 October 2021. The 10.10 Brands Festival will be offering Free Shipping Vouchers with a minimum spend of RM10 and 50% off Big Brand Discounts, along with a chance to Tap and Win a Toyota Vios. The lucky winner will be announced on 13 October 2021.

Iketeru Japanse Buffet (The Hungry Deal) @ Hilton KLIketeru Japanse Buffet (The Hungry Deal) @ Hilton KL","By - -October 1, 2019October 1, 2019
Share on FacebookShare on FacebookTweet on TwitterTweet on Twitter","Many years ago, Iketeru used to serve Japanese buffet and it was on top of my to try list. Iketeru was possibly the best, if not one of the best Japanese restaurants in KL at that time. Their ala carte menu was (and still) quite pricey so having the buffet makes it a more viable option, especially for people young people who could eat a lot.
Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to try the buffet because it was discontinued for a period of time. But good news guys, Iketeru’s Japanese buffet is back – albeit known as The Hungry Deal now.
The main thing you need to know about The Hungry Deal is that it’s an ala carte buffet. So you are presented with a different menu and you can order unlimited servings of each dish.
There’s no time limit per se, as the buffet is served between 12pm and 2.30pm (last order 2pm) in the weekends. The price is RM238++/pax so it’s definitely not cheap. In fact it may be the most expensive Japansee buffet in KL right now.
Probably it’s because of the price, not many people are blogging about it. And FYI this was not an invited review. So if you heard about The Hungry Deal but can’t find any info online, hopefully this entry of mine helps. I have also uploaded a photo album of the full menu so at least you know what to expect from the buffet – menu wise.
As with any Japanse buffet, ordering sashimi is where you make your money back. Iketeru offers 7 types of sashimi which is a lot more compared to most Japanese buffets in KL. Instead of the usual salmon, tuna, tako and butterfish (white tuna), you also get hamachi, shime saba and hokkigai here.
As you can see, we had multiple servings of it. Everything tasted up to standard (for buffet) but we never reordered the butterfish because of reasons you could find via Google.
Teppanyaki is probably the next best item to gorge on after you are bored of the sashimi. Among the list of items available, the Sirloin (Australian Black Angus), halibut and prawn would be the top choices. It’s quite impossible to go wrong with the sirloin as long as you request for the right temperature, eg. no medium well or well done.
It was as tender, juicy and flavorful as you could have dreamed of – beating many “wagyu steaks” I have had so far this year. Teppanyaki sirloin, medium rare, order it as many times as you could eat it, ok?
Not a beef lover? Go for Teppyanyaki Halibut instead. Basically, it tastes like cod with a similar flaky, soft and oily texture.
Teppanyaki prawns were delicious as well, firm and crunchy.
If you love kimchi, you won’t be disappointed with the Kimchi Beef. It’s served medium rare so they are definitely tender. The kimchi was great too, it was exceptionally tangy and spicy – surely a class better than those store bought ones served at the normal Korean restaurants.
Other things we tried included Sanma teriyaki, Tai Kama (sea bream head) shioyaki/teriyaki, soft shell crab/ebi tempura, tai miso shiru (soy bean soup with sea bream head) and a couple of appetizers like chawanmushi and marinated seafood with spice of wasabi.
All of them were not bad but they did not particularly impress us. Some dishes which involved the use of sea bream head were a let down despite tasting good because of they did not scale the fish properly.
We also did not try any of the sushi, rice bowl, noodle or fried items because they are too filling for 2 pax. But if you are dining in a group with more people, then I guess it makes sense to share.
Although dessert is not included in the menu, rest assured you will get it at the end of your meal. It’s an array of ice cream, fruits and cakes served on a boat just like shown above.

"October 1, 2019--","Many years ago, Iketeru used to serve Japanese buffet and it was on top of my to try list. Iketeru was possibly the best, if not one of the best Japanese restaurants in KL at that time. Their ala carte menu was (and still) quite pricey so having the buffet makes it a more viable option, especially for people young people who could eat a lot.
Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to try the buffet because it was discontinued for a period of time. But good news guys, Iketeru’s Japanese buffet is back – albeit known as The Hungry Deal now.
The main thing you need to know about The Hungry Deal is that it’s an ala carte buffet. So you are presented with a different menu and you can order unlimited servings of each dish.
There’s no time limit per se, as the buffet is served between 12pm and 2.30pm (last order 2pm) in the weekends. The price is RM238++/pax so it’s definitely not cheap. In fact it may be the most expensive Japansee buffet in KL right now.
Probably it’s because of the price, not many people are blogging about it. And FYI this was not an invited review. So if you heard about The Hungry Deal but can’t find any info online, hopefully this entry of mine helps. I have also uploaded a photo album of the full menu so at least you know what to expect from the buffet – menu wise.
As with any Japanse buffet, ordering sashimi is where you make your money back. Iketeru offers 7 types of sashimi which is a lot more compared to most Japanese buffets in KL. Instead of the usual salmon, tuna, tako and butterfish (white tuna), you also get hamachi, shime saba and hokkigai here.
As you can see, we had multiple servings of it. Everything tasted up to standard (for buffet) but we never reordered the butterfish because of reasons you could find via Google.
Teppanyaki is probably the next best item to gorge on after you are bored of the sashimi. Among the list of items available, the Sirloin (Australian Black Angus), halibut and prawn would be the top choices. It’s quite impossible to go wrong with the sirloin as long as you request for the right temperature, eg. no medium well or well done.
It was as tender, juicy and flavorful as you could have dreamed of – beating many “wagyu steaks” I have had so far this year. Teppanyaki sirloin, medium rare, order it as many times as you could eat it, ok?
Not a beef lover? Go for Teppyanyaki Halibut instead. Basically, it tastes like cod with a similar flaky, soft and oily texture.
Teppanyaki prawns were delicious as well, firm and crunchy.
If you love kimchi, you won’t be disappointed with the Kimchi Beef. It’s served medium rare so they are definitely tender. The kimchi was great too, it was exceptionally tangy and spicy – surely a class better than those store bought ones served at the normal Korean restaurants.
Other things we tried included Sanma teriyaki, Tai Kama (sea bream head) shioyaki/teriyaki, soft shell crab/ebi tempura, tai miso shiru (soy bean soup with sea bream head) and a couple of appetizers like chawanmushi and marinated seafood with spice of wasabi.
All of them were not bad but they did not particularly impress us. Some dishes which involved the use of sea bream head were a let down despite tasting good because of they did not scale the fish properly.
We also did not try any of the sushi, rice bowl, noodle or fried items because they are too filling for 2 pax. But if you are dining in a group with more people, then I guess it makes sense to share.
Although dessert is not included in the menu, rest assured you will get it at the end of your meal. It’s an array of ice cream, fruits and cakes served on a boat just like shown above.
Lastly, for the price we paid, we expected attentive and impeccable service from the staff from waiting to serving. Since it’s an ala carte buffet it’s understandable that it will take longer than usual for them to send the dishes out, but to wait for about 20-30 minutes for the first dish to be served is not quite acceptable.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Thursday, 16 December 2021",Uncle Chua's Prawn Noodle @ Ampang (via Delivery),"I've read a few good reviews about Uncle Chua's Prawn Noodle @ Ampang and was always tempted to try.....and so I did when I found them on ShopeeFood.
They used to operate from a stall in Restoran Shin Wa in Taman Muda (picked this up from their FB) but now have an outlet of their own in Taman Putra, Ampang and another branch in Bandar Menjalara, Kepong.
I went for their Signature Prawn Noodle @ RM15.90 and requested for mee + meehoon (my default noodles when it comes to prawn noodles).  It was served with prawns, pork, egg, taugeh (beansprouts) and kangkung (water spinach).  RM15.90 seems a bit high since dine-in price is only RM8.90 (for big, RM6.90 for small) but (luckily) the portion isn't as small as most the complaints were about for dine-in (then again, it could be different from dine-in since the price has been marked up). 

First impression when I opened the packet was that it had that prawn-y smell and the broth looked a bit murkier that the usual clearer stock I had elsewhere.  Tasting the broth, it had a sufficient dose of prawn goodness and the soup base was more savoury than sweet.  Based on the video review I saw, it seems that they grind their prawn shells to make the stock.  That's why the soup is always ladled over a sieve to strain whatever finely ground shells that may still be around.
Their medium-sized prawns were fresh and firm, just not as big or sweet tasting as the ones from Red Leaf (Jalan Loke Ye) but, unfortunately, Uncle Chua uses store-bought fried shallots too! :(  The lean pork slices were soft and tender...and had this curled-up look when cooked which made me think they were sliced before cooking.  I'm only highlighting this because the pork is usually cooked in a block before they're sliced thinly (I've seen the cooked pork being sliced that way in some of the prawn noodle stalls I ate at).  Doing it that way, the lean pork slices tend to have a firmer bite (while still tender) and look better in presentation as well.
As for their house-made chilli served with the prawn noodles, it was different from the norm.  Theirs is not like those cooked in oil, thick sambal you usually get elsewhere but a rather watery sambal (that's why I was surprised when it came in a fairly large plastic bag...you can see that in the pic).  From dine-in pics of the sambal (in its sauce plate coz the one in the bag was all mixed up already), I noticed some green parts in the mix.  Some say it's green chilli paste while others mention it's ginger.  Well, I can't be sure since I couldn't taste the components separately since it came mixed up already.  Be warned though to taste the broth first before adding just enough of the spicy sambal as it can be quite salty.
I think the grinding of the prawn shells contributed to its murky look and more intense flavour of the soup base, the intensity of which made it taste stronger, almost like dried prawns.  It was still good, just different, but probably not so to those who have an adversity to the smell and taste of dried prawns.  This would also appeal to those who like their prawn noodles on the savoury side instead of sweet.
It was certainly one of the more decent prawn noodles I've had but if I were to compare it to my favourite prawn noodles in Red Leaf, that one would still have my vote because of the freshness and sweetness of the bigger and firmer sea prawns.  Uncle Chua also offers a dry version of their prawn noodle...now who would want to eat it that way?  For me, it should always be enjoyed in its quintessential way in soup form! ;)
Besides prawn noodles, they also serve Lam Mee @ RM14.90 (there's also an option for lam mee suah).  The broth was packed separately in a large plastic container again (so you can be assured there'll be no spillage) and there were separate packets of their house special chilli sauce mix and black vinegar too.
I'm not a fan of lum mee with its overly thick dark sauce but decided to give this a try since the sauce looked very different in the photos....and it was, not the gluggy, overly cornstarch-ed broth you'd mostly get elsewhere.  It was a decent broth...made even better when you add on the chilli mix (not sure if this is the same chilli mix you get with the prawn noodles but it did look the same all mixed up in the packet)...but I thought this one tasted a bit more tangy (addition of lime juice?).
I asked for a combination of meehoon + kuey teow (since I didn't think that mee suah would 'travel' well) and (again) the noodle portion size was good.  The amount given could be different from dine-in since the price charged for delivery is a lot more (almost double)...and so they thought they needed to make up for it by giving us more noodles....lol!
To enjoy it fully, you'll need to add in the special chilli sauce (and some would say vinegar too) but I never add vinegar into anything (just like I don't add it into loh mee, mock sharksfin soup or Szechuan hot & sour soup) simply because I just don't like the taste of it.
If you didn't order this yourself, you probably wouldn't know that it was lum mee because of the unusual colour of the broth that's not darkly brownish nor blackish (a little bit more orang-y and it could have been mistaken for Penang jawa mee).  So, suffice to say, this was one lum mee I ended up liking.
Rounding up its menu is their pork paste soup (or dry) noodle.  As you can see, they offer only three types of noodles on ShopeeFood though you get a few more options (like eggs & toast, croissant, pre-packed nasi lemak and side snacks of fried beancurd sheets, beancurd rolls, fish cake & mushroom chicken feet) if you dine-in.
The first time I ordered from this eatery, I got myself a Red Bean Tong Sui (Dessert) @ RM5.90 too just so that I could make use of the RM6 discount (for RM18 spending).
There were even some lotus seeds cooked together with the red beans.
Overall, it was a nice red bean tong sui, not too thick and best of all, not too sweet.  I actually prefer a more watery consistency to my red bean dessert, that way I won't feel so ""jelak"" from finishing it.",My Personal Opinion,"This prawn mee reminded me of the Penang-style prawn mee I had from a stall in SS2's Chow Yang Kopitiam once (and, coincidentally, they serve a dry-style prawn mee too) but it isn't going to knock my favourite prawn me off its top billing anytime soon.
For those who prefer a more savoury (than sweet) prawn broth, this could be the one for you (but be warned that it's a bit saltier than the norm, so hold back on the sambal!).  For me, it was a decent prawn noodle but it's not going to be my favourite (or regular) prawn mee because of the price (70% mark-up for delivery from dine-in prices is just too much).  Why would I?  When I can get fresh + big + juicy + sweet + plentiful prawns from Red Leaf for about the same price or even one closer to home that's also cheaper with more liew (ingredients).
The lam mee, however, turned out to be the surprise find for me.  It was certainly one lam mee I can see myself having again just because it's quite different from the norm.",Uncle Chua's Prawn Noodle,No 28 Jalan Bunga Tanjung 8Taman Putra68000 AmpangSelangor,"Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest

Well, at least now you know Uncle Chua's prawn mee is not for you.
To be fair, Uncle Chua's prawn mee is more than decent (if not for the price) but it's just that I've two good choices near me (one for the convenience of location and one for the sweet prawns...hehe). Oh, I see you're not a fan of lam mee too (same same-lah our taste). Yeah, I've seen western chefs roast/saute the prawn/lobster shells to make stock (but didn't see them blitz the shells though). I think the stock has a better flavour this way instead of grinding the shells (too powdery & intense, maybe?). ^_~
No wonder I felt familiar when I read your title, this Uncle Chua Prawn Noodles has an outlet at my area too.
Good effort of putting your prawn me so nicely with all the ingredients on the top as when the the food tapao with plastic bag like that, it's impossible to pour out into a bowl with nice presentation like yours.
I'm not a fan of Lam Mee because I don't really fancy food with thick starchy soup.
Ah, I see there are not many fans of lam mee but this one you might just end up liking coz the soup no where near as starchy as most lam mee out there. Have you tried this prawn mee since you have one in your neighbourhood? P/S: Thanks for acknowledging my effort to present the food as best I can...lol! The key is to not pour all the soup in (until after the photos are taken). ^_~
Does look like a pretty good bowl of prawn mee even tho the price is a bit expensive.
You can opt to dine-in for a more down-to-earth pricing. ^_~
I just ate some bad seafood in Penang and was sick for days. I can't bare the thought of prawns at the moment. I hope that doesn't last too much longer.
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that...hope the bad seafood wasn't from any of the places you reviewed (!)...and hope you're feeling much better now.
I have seen few stalls selling dry prawn mee versions and found it strange. I would definitely prefer the original in soup form with the prawny smell with big prawns. I have been dying to eat prawn me for so long but I am still recuperating where I have to avoid seafood and many others like milk.

I am a big fan of Lam Mee or Lam Mee Suar. Now I think only Penang and Northerners would love to eat this especially during birthdays for longevity. I came across many people including my wife do not fancy Lam Mee or Hokkien Char which are very popular in Penang.
Hi TM, glad to hear from you as you've been 'silent' for a while. I'm aware that you must be recuperating and hope everything's going well in that process. Don't worry, tahan for a bit longer and I'm sure you'll get to indulge in seafood again soon...and prawn mee too. For now, focus on getting better, that's more important. Funny thing is that this dry prawn mee I've seen offered by (supposedly authentic) Penang hawkers only...so it must be a 'thing' in Penang? ;)

Yeah, I agree with you that there are probably not that many fans of lam mee & Hokkien char over here as in Penang, that's why not many places offer them here.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Friday, 10 December 2021",Just One Food - McD's Sweet Chilli Fish Burger,"When it comes to McDonald's, I don't eat (or hardly ever eat) their meat burgers for the simple reason I don't like their meat patties.  So, it has always been the Filet-O-Fish burger for me when it comes to McD burgers.
I've been aware of this McD's Sweet Chilli Fish Burger for a while now but wasn't tempted to try as I initially thought it would be a fish burger with some sort of Thai sweet chilli sauce (based on its name and I find Thai sweet chilli sauce to be overly sweet), so I never wanted to try.
But one day, I got sick and tired of Filet-O-Fish and decided to finally give McD's Sweet Chilli Fish Burger a try (this burger has been around since 2019 but I'm only trying it now...lol).
Well, first of all, you have a piece of crispy fish fillet that's more heavily battered and crumbed than the Filet-O-Fish while retaining that same light crispiness.  The Filet-O-Fish is made with Alaska Pollock Fillets but McD doesn't mention what fish comes with this fish burger but you certainly get a much bigger piece of fish with the Sweet Chilli Fish Burger.
Couldn't detect any difference in the taste of the fish itself as both had that soft, flaky texture though the Filet-O-Fish is slightly softer but the Sweet Chilli Fish Burger gives a better bite because of the batter and the size of the fish ultimately. 
The difference between the two lies in its sauce, of course.  While the Filet-O-Fish is topped with zesty tartar sauce (and a slice of cheddar cheese which I always ask for it to be omitted) between soft buns, this one is supposedly topped with a sweet & spicy sauce but I tasted only spicy...and it was very spicy! >_<  The sauce is somewhat like a very spicy version of Thousand Island or a chipotle sauce.
There's the usual mixed vegetables of shredded lettuce, purple cabbage and carrot to give it that crunch factor.  The set comes with the usual fries and a drink.
I did enjoy the flavour of the sauce even if it was rather spicy for me....this is my new go-to McD burger for now.  For one, it doesn't come with cheese, so I don't have to request for it to be omitted coz sometimes they forget to do that (and I've to tear it off my burger when it arrives). >.<
For those who like their food spicy, they would definitely prefer this spicy fish burger as it brings some serious heat!  I can't handle overly spicy food and this is just about tolerable for me...nothing a few gulps of water (in-between) can't fix! ;P
And hehey, guess who's back?  My favourite peppery prosperity patties!  Even though I hardly ever eat their meat burgers, this is one exception I'm happy to make...and it's always the Prosperity Beef Burger for me.
Though the black pepper sauce can be too much and a bit overpowering at times, I love the taste of the hot peppery sauce together with the meat and crunchy onions...so I just scrape some excess away if there's too much (but this time, the quantity of the sauce was just right).  And oh, McD just got on ShopeeFood too! ^.^","Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: Fast Food, Just One Food",4 comments:,"I did not even know of the existence of McD's sweet chili fish. I used to love the fillet o fish because the buns were so soft and fluffy. They only put half a slice of cheese and I remembered reading about why only half but if you ask me now I cannot remember the reason LOL! Ah! I want the prosperity burger as it has been an all time favorite. But I remember last's year's was too peppery for my liking. I'll order it and will add an order for the sweet chili fish too!
Ya, I remember that it used to be very peppery too but that's probably because they gave too much sauce. Ah, if you love the filet-o-fish, then I'm sure you'll love this sweet chilli one even more coz it's got the heat you like. Enjoy your prosperity burger & sweet chilli fish! ;)
My choice of burger at McD are spicy chicken mcdeluxe and fillet-o-fish. I never miss to order the prosperity burger but I found that the black pepper sauce is getting spicier over the years and I don't like it anymore. The main attraction to me is the curly fries in the set but since I can get it from my FB live platform, I'm thinking should I continue to support the prosperity burger?
Surprisingly, my prosperity burger wasn't as spicy as previous years...probably coz I got less sauce this round (I think it's different from branch to branch). The bun used to come drenched in black pepper but, as you can see from the pic, the bun stays practically 'dry' this time...lol! :D

"Eat what, Eat where?","Monday, 6 December 2021",Little Boy Wonton Noodles @ Pandan Indah (via Tapau & Delivery),"This Little Boy Wonton Noodles @ Pandan Indah was an accidental find to begin with.  This stall is located in the same coffee shop (Restoran Xin Fu Ji) which houses what I consider the best char siew rice in Pandan Indah (I like to call it Fajar char siew fan because of its location near Fajar Supermarket previously, now it's The Store).
I first noticed the wantan mee stall (operated by a father and son team I think) when I was patronising the soy dessert stall next to it (check out the latest update on this at the end of this post).  Each time I was there to get lunch from either the Fu Ji Chicken Rice stall or to satisfy my want for something cold from Soy Desserts by Soy Bar), I'd be standing near the stall but always looking only.  You see, I already have my go-to wantan mee stall here in Pandan Indah, so I'm not aggressively looking for another...lol.
But one day, I saw them frying crispy wontons fresh on the spot and they looked mighty fine, so I went with an order of Deep-Fried Wonton Noodles @ RM7.
The dry wonton noodles came with 7 freshly fried wontons (yes, you heard right, tujuh...seven!!).  I was shocked but dancing with joy (in my mind only lah) that they gave seven...and, mind you, they weren't those mini wontons you get at other wantan mee stalls, these were good-sized ones. ^o^
When I ordered it via ShopeeFood, I thought I got less wontons but thought I miscalculated.  Only after having it a few more times, I realised there was no miscalculation (first it was one less....then two)! ;P  But there's no reason to complain simply because the stall didn't up the price like other eateries did.
The next round I tried the BBQ Pork (or Char Siew) Wonton Noodles @ RM7 coz this is wantan mee after all and you can't say you've had their wantan mee if you had not tried their char siew (the reddish kind that's usually used by most wantan mee stalls, not the highly caramelised ones like those you get at roasted meat stalls).  Unfortunately, the char siew was all lean (not that I mind), so it lost a bit of that tenderness + it was also cut too thickly (char siew that's on the lean side should be cut thinly for a more tender bite).
As good as the deep-fried wonton noodles was, the Deep-Fried Prawn Dumpling (or Siu Kow) Noodles @ RM7 was right up there too.  The serving comes with 3 plump-sized fried prawn dumpling filled with minced pork and chopped prawns together with diced sengkuang (sweet turnip) and shredded wood-ear fungus for that well sought-after crunchy texture. ^.^
However, don't be too happy coz the 3 dumplings (through tapau) was reduced to only two when I ordered via ShopeeFood.  I've to admit I was a bit disappointed at first to see only two pieces of fried dumpling but then there's no cause for complaint really since the stall maintained the same in-store price.
The difference between the fried wonton and the fried dumpling is the addition of prawns for the latter.  So, if you're one who likes a meaty dumpling with prawns, then the fried prawn dumpling noodles should be your pick but if you prefer a crispier bite, you're more likely to get that from the fried wontons.
The next option that I tried was their Braised Chicken Feet with Mushroom Noodles @ RM7.  Their braised chicken feet is the type that has been fried first before it was braised.  I actually prefer those chicken feet that's just braised only (without being deep-fried) a tad more but would still enjoy both versions since I like to eat chicken feet (but sparingly).
Though the braised chicken feet was decent as it was braised till tender, it wasn't outstanding enough in terms of the flavour of the braise compared to some of the better ones I've eaten, so this was my least favourite offering of theirs.
Finally, there's the Roasted Pork (or Siu Yuk) Wonton Noodles @ RM7 but this is not available every day but certainly during the weekends according to the stall owner (on other days, he'll make it if he has the time).
As you can see, the siu yuk is very lean (just like the char siew), so if you like your meat lean, then this one is it.  I certainly don't mind but the meat will not be as tender and luscious as those with more fat, of course. The siu yuk skin is still crunchy but a little hard.
I like the texture of the noodles too, cooked just right, even if the sauce isn't quite there yet (but I've noticed some improvement and it's growing on me).  I appreciate the addition of pork lard (and pork lard oil) in their noodles as it makes everything tastes better.  And if you're lucky, you get as many as 5 good-sized pieces of fried pork lard....and theirs is always fresh, always crispy, always fragrant! ^.^
Even though I got less fried wontons or dumplings, I would still order this wantan mee through ShopeeFood whenever I feel like having it since I can make use of the RM2 discount (where else can you get a plate of wantan noodles for only RM5 these days!) + it sure beats the heck out of having to drive there myself.
Latest Update: After seeing them not available on ShopeeFood for a few days, I finally ventured out to tapau and found out that they're off ShopeeFood for a while as they wanted to increase prices.  As I expected all along, the stall owner was a bit inexperienced (with food delivery) and made a mistake of not adding on the commission charged by food delivery platforms to their prices (that's why they were such a great deal).  Oh well, ""the good times"" had to come to an end some time...and it's back to tapau-ing!  ShopeeFood told them they'll have to wait till February next year before they can increase prices, so they'll have to 'disapppear' for a while! :P
Sad Update: Soy Desserts by Soy Bar has upped and left! T_T  In its place is another soy dessert stall called Soykid (I noticed the difference when I wanted to tapau...but didn't in the end).  The stall was mumbling away something in Chinese (which I could not understand clearly) that they're still the same (or something to that effect).  But how can you be the same if your name
My go-to wantan mee in my neighbourhood is the one from Restoran Lucky 6 and I've never felt the need to look for another one but now that I've stumbled upon good fried wontons and dumplings, I have another avenue for wantan mee from Restoran Xin Fu Ji.
The soup version though still belongs to the one from Restoran Lucky 6 for me based on the taste of the soup.....and they can come with add-on fried wantans too.",My Personal Opinion,This is now my favourite wonton noodle (dry version only) in my neighbourhood...but only when it comes with fried wontons (so big and so many!) or fried prawn dumplings (so filled with liew!).....so good! ^_~,Little Boy Wonton Noodles,"35G Jalan Pandan Indah 1/23B

Heheh, the more, the merrier! ;)
Those fried wonton definitely in very good size, those I got from the wonton mee stalls at my neighbourhood are like ""cucu"" of yours, so tiny. >_<
The first thing I noticed in your second photo (bowl of wonton mee) was the small bits of zhu yao zha, hehe :P
Actually I like my dry wonton a bit darker because in my thought, the darker the more flavours.
Ya, the pork lard oil and crispy pork lard do make a difference in the flavours. Actually, most stalls will give you ""cucu""-sized wontons...these were the biggest sized ones I've had with wantan mee.
I have yet to eat wanton mee that is served with fried wanton. On my area, my only go to is Annie 1's wanton mee which I always enjoy. There is a Big Big Wanton nearby which I have been meaning to try. Let me check if they serve fried wanton hee..hee..
I no need to go to Big Big Wanton and already got big-sized wontons...hehehe! ^_~
7 wantons is a good deal. Love fried wantons too, although I prefer to have them on the side as a snack. Not a fan of having them on the noodles. I'm also a fan of having those roasted meat type char siew for my wanton noodles. So this one probably not for me. The fried wantons look great though. Maybe they'll let me buy just fried wantons, I wonder?
Actually, I kinda despise and refuse to acknowledge these red colored lean meat as char siew. I stubbornly call them fake char siew hahaha. And it seems every single wanton mee stall in Penang uses these fake stuff exclusively, so I despise Penang wanton mee as a whole too.
Actually, quite a few of the KL wantan mee stalls also serve this reddish-type char siew. I'm ok with it (as long as it's not char siew rice). Oh, you're in luck...they do sell just the fried wantons (I saw their menu on ShopeeFood but don't know how many you get for the price charged though)! ^.^
My wife and I are crazy over fried wontons or sui kows. We would often order a plate full that would be 10 to 15 pieces of wontons regardless of big or small ones. I love to eat wanton noodles with Char Siew but this is the first time I heard of siew yok being served together. I am like PH who frequents Annie-1 for a good plate of Wanton Noodles. I know many other stalls are better than Annie-1 but they are in other territories.
Wah, you've 'disappeared' for 2 months...glad to see you back here. Hope everything's fine with you health-wise. Yeah, me too, like you, my family likes to order fried wantons & sui kow as a side dish to share.

"Eat what, Eat where?","Thursday, 16 December 2021",Uncle Chua's Prawn Noodle @ Ampang (via Delivery),"I've read a few good reviews about Uncle Chua's Prawn Noodle @ Ampang and was always tempted to try.....and so I did when I found them on ShopeeFood.
They used to operate from a stall in Restoran Shin Wa in Taman Muda (picked this up from their FB) but now have an outlet of their own in Taman Putra, Ampang and another branch in Bandar Menjalara, Kepong.
I went for their Signature Prawn Noodle @ RM15.90 and requested for mee + meehoon (my default noodles when it comes to prawn noodles).  It was served with prawns, pork, egg, taugeh (beansprouts) and kangkung (water spinach).  RM15.90 seems a bit high since dine-in price is only RM8.90 (for big, RM6.90 for small) but (luckily) the portion isn't as small as most the complaints were about for dine-in (then again, it could be different from dine-in since the price has been marked up). 

First impression when I opened the packet was that it had that prawn-y smell and the broth looked a bit murkier that the usual clearer stock I had elsewhere.  Tasting the broth, it had a sufficient dose of prawn goodness and the soup base was more savoury than sweet.  Based on the video review I saw, it seems that they grind their prawn shells to make the stock.  That's why the soup is always ladled over a sieve to strain whatever finely ground shells that may still be around.
Their medium-sized prawns were fresh and firm, just not as big or sweet tasting as the ones from Red Leaf (Jalan Loke Ye) but, unfortunately, Uncle Chua uses store-bought fried shallots too! :(  The lean pork slices were soft and tender...and had this curled-up look when cooked which made me think they were sliced before cooking.  I'm only highlighting this because the pork is usually cooked in a block before they're sliced thinly (I've seen the cooked pork being sliced that way in some of the prawn noodle stalls I ate at).  Doing it that way, the lean pork slices tend to have a firmer bite (while still tender) and look better in presentation as well.
As for their house-made chilli served with the prawn noodles, it was different from the norm.  Theirs is not like those cooked in oil, thick sambal you usually get elsewhere but a rather watery sambal (that's why I was surprised when it came in a fairly large plastic bag...you can see that in the pic).  From dine-in pics of the sambal (in its sauce plate coz the one in the bag was all mixed up already), I noticed some green parts in the mix.  Some say it's green chilli paste while others mention it's ginger.  Well, I can't be sure since I couldn't taste the components separately since it came mixed up already.  Be warned though to taste the broth first before adding just enough of the spicy sambal as it can be quite salty.
I think the grinding of the prawn shells contributed to its murky look and more intense flavour of the soup base, the intensity of which made it taste stronger, almost like dried prawns.  It was still good, just different, but probably not so to those who have an adversity to the smell and taste of dried prawns.  This would also appeal to those who like their prawn noodles on the savoury side instead of sweet.
It was certainly one of the more decent prawn noodles I've had but if I were to compare it to my favourite prawn noodles in Red Leaf, that one would still have my vote because of the freshness and sweetness of the bigger and firmer sea prawns.  Uncle Chua also offers a dry version of their prawn noodle...now who would want to eat it that way?  For me, it should always be enjoyed in its quintessential way in soup form! ;)
Besides prawn noodles, they also serve Lam Mee @ RM14.90 (there's also an option for lam mee suah).  The broth was packed separately in a large plastic container again (so you can be assured there'll be no spillage) and there were separate packets of their house special chilli sauce mix and black vinegar too.
I'm not a fan of lum mee with its overly thick dark sauce but decided to give this a try since the sauce looked very different in the photos....and it was, not the gluggy, overly cornstarch-ed broth you'd mostly get elsewhere.  It was a decent broth...made even better when you add on the chilli mix (not sure if this is the same chilli mix you get with the prawn noodles but it did look the same all mixed up in the packet)...but I thought this one tasted a bit more tangy (addition of lime juice?).
I asked for a combination of meehoon + kuey teow (since I didn't think that mee suah would 'travel' well) and (again) the noodle portion size was good.  The amount given could be different from dine-in since the price charged for delivery is a lot more (almost double)...and so they thought they needed to make up for it by giving us more noodles....lol!
To enjoy it fully, you'll need to add in the special chilli sauce (and some would say vinegar too) but I never add vinegar into anything (just like I don't add it into loh mee, mock sharksfin soup or Szechuan hot & sour soup) simply because I just don't like the taste of it.
If you didn't order this yourself, you probably wouldn't know that it was lum mee because of the unusual colour of the broth that's not darkly brownish nor blackish (a little bit more orang-y and it could have been mistaken for Penang jawa mee).  So, suffice to say, this was one lum mee I ended up liking.
Rounding up its menu is their pork paste soup (or dry) noodle.  As you can see, they offer only three types of noodles on ShopeeFood though you get a few more options (like eggs & toast, croissant, pre-packed nasi lemak and side snacks of fried beancurd sheets, beancurd rolls, fish cake & mushroom chicken feet) if you dine-in.
The first time I ordered from this eatery, I got myself a Red Bean Tong Sui (Dessert) @ RM5.90 too just so that I could make use of the RM6 discount (for RM18 spending).
There were even some lotus seeds cooked together with the red beans.
Overall, it was a nice red bean tong sui, not too thick and best of all, not too sweet.  I actually prefer a more watery consistency to my red bean dessert, that way I won't feel so ""jelak"" from finishing it.",My Personal Opinion,"This prawn mee reminded me of the Penang-style prawn mee I had from a stall in SS2's Chow Yang Kopitiam once (and, coincidentally, they serve a dry-style prawn mee too) but it isn't going to knock my favourite prawn me off its top billing anytime soon.
For those who prefer a more savoury (than sweet) prawn broth, this could be the one for you (but be warned that it's a bit saltier than the norm, so hold back on the sambal!).  For me, it was a decent prawn noodle but it's not going to be my favourite (or regular) prawn mee because of the price (70% mark-up for delivery from dine-in prices is just too much).  Why would I?  When I can get fresh + big + juicy + sweet + plentiful prawns from Red Leaf for about the same price or even one closer to home that's also cheaper with more liew (ingredients).
The lam mee, however, turned out to be the surprise find for me.  It was certainly one lam mee I can see myself having again just because it's quite different from the norm.",Uncle Chua's Prawn Noodle,No 28 Jalan Bunga Tanjung 8Taman Putra68000 AmpangSelangor,"Email ThisEmail ThisEmail ThisShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest
Labels: Food Delivery, Food: Chinese, Location: Ampang, Oodles of Noodles",10 comments:,"I didn't know that there is such a thing as dry style prawn mee. I just can't imagine what that would be like. I have seen on TV how western chefs blend prawn/lobster shells and such in their blenders and then strain the broth. Seems like a lot of work (and need a high powered blender)but will yield more intense flavors. I am not a fan of lam mee, perhaps I have not found a good one yet. Well, at least now you know Uncle Chua's prawn mee is not for you.
To be fair, Uncle Chua's prawn mee is more than decent (if not for the price) but it's just that I've two good choices near me (one for the convenience of location and one for the sweet prawns...hehe). Oh, I see you're not a fan of lam mee too (same same-lah our taste). Yeah, I've seen western chefs roast/saute the prawn/lobster shells to make stock (but didn't see them blitz the shells though). I think the stock has a better flavour this way instead of grinding the shells (too powdery & intense, maybe?). ^_~
No wonder I felt familiar when I read your title, this Uncle Chua Prawn Noodles has an outlet at my area too.
Good effort of putting your prawn me so nicely with all the ingredients on the top as when the the food tapao with plastic bag like that, it's impossible to pour out into a bowl with nice presentation like yours.
I'm not a fan of Lam Mee because I don't really fancy food with thick starchy soup.
Ah, I see there are not many fans of lam mee but this one you might just end up liking coz the soup no where near as starchy as most lam mee out there. Have you tried this prawn mee since you have one in your neighbourhood? P/S: Thanks for acknowledging my effort to present the food as best I can...lol! The key is to not pour all the soup in (until after the photos are taken). ^_~
Does look like a pretty good bowl of prawn mee even tho the price is a bit expensive.
You can opt to dine-in for a more down-to-earth pricing. ^_~
I just ate some bad seafood in Penang and was sick for days. I can't bare the thought of prawns at the moment. I hope that doesn't last too much longer.
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that...hope the bad seafood wasn't from any of the places you reviewed (!)...and hope you're feeling much better now.
I have seen few stalls selling dry prawn mee versions and found it strange. I would definitely prefer the original in soup form with the prawny smell with big prawns. I have been dying to eat prawn me for so long but I am still recuperating where I have to avoid seafood and many others like milk.

I am a big fan of Lam Mee or Lam Mee Suar. Now I think only Penang and Northerners would love to eat this especially during birthdays for longevity. I came across many people including my wife do not fancy Lam Mee or Hokkien Char which are very popular in Penang.
Hi TM, glad to hear from you as you've been 'silent' for a while. I'm aware that you must be recuperating and hope everything's going well in that process. Don't worry, tahan for a bit longer and I'm sure you'll get to indulge in seafood again soon...and prawn mee too. For now, focus on getting better, that's more important. Funny thing is that this dry prawn mee I've seen offered by (supposedly authentic) Penang hawkers only...so it must be a 'thing' in Penang? ;)

Yeah, I agree with you that there are probably not that many fans of lam mee & Hokkien char over here as in Penang, that's why not many places offer them here.
